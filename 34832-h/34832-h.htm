<br /><i>AN UNINVITED GUEST</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, what can be delaying Dad? He
promised faithfully to be home by three o&rsquo;clock and
it&rsquo;s nearly five now. Unless we start soon we&rsquo;ll never
get to Sunset Beach tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny Parker, in blue slacks and a slightly mussed
polo shirt, gazed disconsolately at the over-loaded automobile
standing on the gravel driveway of the
Parker home. Aided by Mrs. Weems, the family
housekeeper, she had spent hours packing the sedan
with luggage and camping equipment. Though the
task long had been finished, Mr. Parker failed to arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is a very busy man,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems responded
to the girl&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;No doubt he&rsquo;s been
held up at the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t he telephone? It&rsquo;s driving me
crazy to wait and wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s freckled little face twisted into a grimace
of worry. For weeks she and her father, editor-owner
of the <i>Riverview Star</i>, had planned a vacation
camping trip to the nearby seashore resort, Sunset
Beach. Twice the excursion had been postponed.
Penny, who knew well her father&rsquo;s habit of changing
his mind, was fearful that even now something would
cause another vexing delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call the <i>Star</i> office this minute!&rdquo; she
declared, starting for the house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems busied herself gathering up loose odds
and ends that had blown about the yard. She was
cramming waste paper into a box when Penny banged
out the door, her eyes tragic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t reach Dad!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;He left
the office more than an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he should have been home before this,&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened. Maybe he&rsquo;s been run
down by a car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Penny, stop such wild talk,&rdquo; the housekeeper
interrupted sternly. &ldquo;You know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad was struck by an automobile last winter.
What else could delay him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dozen things,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems replied. &ldquo;Probably
a business engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t he have telephoned me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. Now do stop fretting, Penny.
Your father will be here before long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better be,&rdquo; Penny said darkly.</p>
<p>Sitting down on the stone step by the door, she
scuffed the toe of her tennis shoe back and forth in
the gravel. Mrs. Weems who had cared for the girl
ever since the death of Mrs. Parker, gazed at her
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do stop grieving!&rdquo; she chided. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no
way to act just because you&rsquo;re impatient and disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been disappointed three times now,&rdquo;
Penny complained. &ldquo;We planned on starting early
and having a picnic lunch on the road. Dad promised
faithfully&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A car drove up to the curb at the front of the
house. Penny sprang hopefully to her feet. However,
it was not her father who had arrived. Instead,
her chum, Louise Sidell, alighted and came running
across the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not too late to say goodbye to
you, Penny!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How soon are you starting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know the answer to that one myself.
Dad hasn&rsquo;t put in an appearance. He was due here
at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I saw him about twenty minutes ago,&rdquo;
Louise replied, turning to inspect the over-loaded
sedan. &ldquo;My, how did you accumulate so much luggage?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Penny ignored the question to ask one of her own.
&ldquo;Where did you see Dad, Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, riding in a car.&rdquo; Louise&rsquo;s dark eyes
sparkled mischievously as she added: &ldquo;With a beautiful
brunette too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not. Your father was riding with Mrs. Deline.
She&rsquo;s a widow, you know, and has lived in
Riverview less than a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems, who had overheard the conversation,
came over to the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline, did you say?&rdquo; she inquired, slightly
disturbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have I!&rdquo; declared Penny with biting emphasis.
&ldquo;Why, that woman would make the Merry
Widow look like a dead number! She&rsquo;d better not
try to sink her hooks into Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penelope!&rdquo; the housekeeper reproved sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what everyone says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t repeat idle gossip,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems requested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Deline is a very fine
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the slickest serpent that ever free-wheeled
into Riverview!&rdquo; Penny said heatedly. &ldquo;I saw her
in action last week-end at the Country Club. Why,
she simply went out of her way to cultivate any man
who had an income of more than twenty-five thousand
a year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, your father is a sensible man,&rdquo; the housekeeper
reproved. &ldquo;Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a quality I&rsquo;m
afraid you didn&rsquo;t inherit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise, unhappy to have stirred up such a hornet&rsquo;s
nest, said hastily: &ldquo;Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Deline I
saw. The car went by so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not worried. Dad can handle a bigger
package of dynamite than Mrs. Deline. It just makes
me irritated because he doesn&rsquo;t get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tossing her head, Penny crossed to the loaded
automobile where she switched on the radio. She
tuned it carelessly. After a moment a blurred voice
blared forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention Comrades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned quickly to glance at the dial, for she
realized that she did not have the local station
WZAM.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention Comrades!&rdquo; the announcer commanded
again. &ldquo;This is the Voice from the Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a strange jibberish of words which
were in no language that Penny ever before had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems! Louise!&rdquo; she called excitedly. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ve tuned in an outlaw short wave station!
Just listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise and the housekeeper hastened over to the
car. Penny tried desperately to tune the station in
more clearly. Instead she lost it completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what that announcer said?&rdquo; she
asked eagerly. &ldquo;Most of it I couldn&rsquo;t understand.
I&rsquo;m sure it was in code!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code!&rdquo; Mrs. Weems exclaimed in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t have one of the regular stations!
It must have been a short wave broadcast beamed at
a particular group of persons. The announcer began:
&lsquo;Attention Comrades!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tune in again?&rdquo; Louise demanded.</p>
<p>Penny twisted the dial without success. She was
still trying when a taxi cab drew up at the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your father now!&rdquo; Louise declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see who&rsquo;s with him!&rdquo; Penny added, craning
her neck. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> Mrs. Deline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems, decidedly flustered, hurriedly removed
her apron. In an undertone she warned Penny
to be polite to the unexpected visitor.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker, a tall, lean man with hair only touched
by gray, stepped from the taxi. The woman he
assisted was attractively slender, and dressed in an
expensive tailored suit. Her face was cold and serene,
but so striking that it commanded instant interest.
Penny&rsquo;s spirits sagged as she observed that the widow
came equipped with luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker escorted Mrs. Deline across the yard,
introducing her first to Mrs. Weems and then to the
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline is riding with us to Sunset Beach,&rdquo;
he explained to Penny. &ldquo;She intended to go by train
but failed to get a reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coaches are so unbearable,&rdquo; Mrs. Deline said in an
affected drawl. &ldquo;It was so nice of Mr. Parker to invite
me to share your car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it may not be so pleasant for you,&rdquo;
Penny replied. She tried to speak cordially but the
words came in stiff little jerks. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline will
ride up front. Penny, you&rsquo;ll have to battle it out with
the luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s suitcase and hat boxes
were stowed away, there was indeed little room left
in the rear seat for a passenger. Penny&rsquo;s face was
very long. For weeks she had planned on a vacation
trip with her father, and now all her plans had been
shattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be staying long at Sunset Beach?&rdquo; she
asked the widow politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a week,&rdquo; Mrs. Deline replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve engaged
a suite at the Crystal Inn. I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t
endure a camping trip. Mosquitoes&mdash;hard beds&mdash;cooking
over a camp fire&mdash;it all seems rather difficult
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be fun to camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain of it myself.&rdquo; Mr. Parker
assisted the widow into the front seat. &ldquo;Penny, why
don&rsquo;t we ditch this camp stuff and try a hotel ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered Penny fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a far more sensible arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be sensible,&rdquo; Penny argued.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve planned on this trip for weeks, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, if that&rsquo;s the way you feel about it,&rdquo;
he gave in willingly enough. &ldquo;Only I never did care
much for the rough and tumble life myself. Are we
ready to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; Penny requested. &ldquo;I have to get
my pocketbook from the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went indoors, her face as dark as a summer rain
cloud. Mrs. Weems and Louise followed her in, corraling
her in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Penny, just a word of advice,&rdquo; the housekeeper
cautioned. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline seems like a very
nice woman. I trust that you&rsquo;ll be pleasant to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Dad had to invite her! It&rsquo;s ruined
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being selfish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;But why should I be
crammed back with the pots and pans and luggage
while she sits up front with Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline is your guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Dad&rsquo;s guest,&rdquo; Penny corrected. &ldquo;Furthermore,
I suspect she invited herself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you think, I hope you&rsquo;ll keep your
thoughts to yourself,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems said severely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really ashamed of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep scowl disappeared from Penny&rsquo;s face and
she laughed. Wrapping her arms about the housekeeper&rsquo;s
ample waist she squeezed until it hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a spoiled brat,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll pretend to like Mrs. Deline if it
kills me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better, Penny. At any rate, you&rsquo;ll
not be troubled with her company long. You&rsquo;ll reach
Sunset Beach by nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny made no reply. She turned to say goodbye
to Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you were going along,&rdquo; she said wistfully.
&ldquo;A vacation won&rsquo;t seem fun without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A staccato toot of the auto horn reminded Penny
that her father and Mrs. Deline were waiting. Hurriedly
she gathered up her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a nice time,&rdquo; Louise said, kissing her goodbye.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let Mrs. Deline get in your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned to make certain that Mrs. Weems
was beyond hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, Lou,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s already in my hair. What I&rsquo;m really
worried about is keeping her from building a nest
in it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>

<br /><i>STORMY WEATHER</i></h2>
<p>For an hour the Parker car had rolled smoothly
along the paved road enroute to Sunset Beach. In
the back seat, firmly wedged between boxes and suitcases,
Penny squirmed and suffered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther, Dad?&rdquo; she inquired, interrupting
an animated conversation he was having with Mrs.
Deline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about fifty miles,&rdquo; Mr. Parker tossed over his
shoulder. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make much time at thirty-five
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about lunch somewhere along the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, should we take the time?&rdquo; the publisher
asked. He turned toward his companion. &ldquo;What do
you think, Mrs. Deline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picnics always seemed stupid to me,&rdquo; she replied
in a bored manner. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll find a nice tea
house along the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Weems prepared such a good lunch,&rdquo;
Penny argued. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can use the food after we make camp,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker decided briskly. &ldquo;A warm meal will be much
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny subsided into hurt silence. Since the party
had left Riverview she felt that she had been pushed
far into the background. Mrs. Deline had made no
attempt to talk to her. On the other hand, the widow
fairly hypnotized Mr. Parker with her dazzling smile
and conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Penny began, determined to get in a word,
&ldquo;just before you came home this afternoon, something
queer happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; he inquired carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I turned on the radio, and a station I&rsquo;d never
heard before came in. The announcer said: &lsquo;Attention
Comrades, this is the Voice from the Cave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a juvenile radio serial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it wasn&rsquo;t, Dad! I&rsquo;m sure it was an outlaw
station. Then the announcer spoke very rapidly in
a language I&rsquo;d never heard before. It really sounded
like code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t imagine it? You know you do
get ideas, Penny. Especially when you&rsquo;re on the
prowl for a mystery to solve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t children quaint?&rdquo; Mrs. Deline laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s lips tightened, but by great effort of will
she kept silent. A child indeed! She knew now that
Mrs. Deline disliked her and that they had launched
an undeclared war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the broadcast all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For
that matter, so did Mrs. Weems and Louise. But
probably it&rsquo;s of no consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject was dropped. It was stuffy in the
closed car and Penny presently rolled down a window.
Immediately Mrs. Deline protested that the
wind was blowing her hair helter-skelter. At a stern
glance from her father, Penny closed the window
again, leaving only a tiny crack for air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the way, please,&rdquo; requested Mrs. Deline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;re being very, very difficult,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker added.</p>
<p>Penny rolled the window shut, but her blue eyes
cast off little sparks of fire. As a rule, she was a very
pleasant person, not in the least spoiled. In Riverview
where she had lived for fifteen happy, eventful years,
her friends were beyond count. Penny liked people
and nearly everyone liked her. But for some reason,
she and Mrs. Deline had taken an instant dislike to
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m jealous,&rdquo; Penny thought ruefully. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t be, but Dad&rsquo;s all I have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Between Mr. Parker and his daughter there existed
a deep bond of affection. Penny&rsquo;s mother was dead
and the noted publisher had devoted himself to filling
the great void in the girl&rsquo;s life. He had given her
companionship and taught her to think straight.
Knowing that she was dependable, he allowed her
more freedom than most girls her age were permitted.</p>
<p>Penny adored her father and seemingly had inherited
his love of newspaper work. Upon various occasions
she had helped him at the <i>Riverview Star</i>,
writing and obtaining some of the paper&rsquo;s most spectacular
front page stories. Only the past winter, following
her father&rsquo;s severe illness, she had acted as
editor of the <i>Star</i>, managing the paper entirely herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now Dad and Mrs. Deline treat me as if I
were a child!&rdquo; she reflected resentfully.</p>
<p>Though very much upset, Penny kept her thoughts
to herself. Curling up with her head on a pile of
blankets, she pretended to sleep.</p>
<p>The car went over a hard bump. Penny bounced
and opened her eyes. She was surprised to see that
it had grown quite dark. The automobile was moving
in a wide curve between long rows of pine trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; she asked, pressing her face to
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so late,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running
into a rain storm. Just our luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dark clouds had entirely blotted out the late afternoon
sun. Even as Mr. Parker spoke, several big
raindrops splashed against the windshield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Soon the rain came down in such a thick sheet that
the road ahead was obscured. Stopping suddenly for
a crossroads traffic light, the car went into a slight
skid. Mrs. Deline screamed in terror, and clutched
Mr. Parker&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t we stop somewhere?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so afraid we&rsquo;ll have an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll stop,&rdquo; Mr. Parker agreed. &ldquo;The storm
is certainly getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short distance ahead the party glimpsed a group
of buildings. One was a filling station and beside it
stood a small three-story hotel and tea room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look too bad,&rdquo; Mr. Parker commented,
pulling up close to the door. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have dinner and
by that time the storm may be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Penny and Mrs. Deline went into the tea room,
the publisher took the car next door to the
filling station to have the tank refueled. He rejoined
them soon, shaking the raindrops from his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming down harder than ever,&rdquo; he reported.
&ldquo;And we still have a long drive ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll reach our camp site tonight,
Dad?&rdquo; Penny inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be lucky to get to Sunset Beach. As for
making camp, that&rsquo;s out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will stop raining soon,&rdquo; Penny ventured
hopefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker ordered dinner for the party and an
hour was consumed in dining. The rain, however,
showed no signs of slackening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go on&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Parker said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Of course, the roads are slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please let&rsquo;s not venture out in this,&rdquo; Mrs.
Deline pleaded before Penny could speak. &ldquo;I know
I am being silly, but I&rsquo;m so afraid of an accident.
Once I was in a car that overturned and I&rsquo;ve never
forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no great hurry,&rdquo; Mr. Parker replied. &ldquo;If
we can&rsquo;t reach Sunset Beach tonight, I suppose we
could stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline did not comment upon the suggestion,
but from the way she smiled, Penny was sure that the
idea appealed to her. Taking her father aside, the
girl urged him to try to drive on to Sunset Beach that
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our vacation is so short, Dad. Even now we&rsquo;ll
lose almost a day in setting up camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll certainly push on if we can,&rdquo; he promised.
&ldquo;This storm complicates everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two hours the rain fell steadily. With the
prospects anything but improved, Mr. Parker made
inquiry as to lodging for the night. From the hotel
keeper he learned that rooms already were at a premium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make up our minds soon,&rdquo; he reported
to Penny and Mrs. Deline. &ldquo;If we wait much
longer we&rsquo;ll probably find ourselves sleeping in the
lobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s stay,&rdquo; the widow urged. &ldquo;Please engage
a room and a bath for me. Preferably one at the
rear of the building away from the highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have no choice,&rdquo; Mr. Parker told
her regretfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take what we can
get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher consulted with the hotel clerk, and
returned to report that only two rooms remained
available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Penny will have to share one together,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident by the expression of Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s
face that she minded a great deal. However, she
consented to the arrangement and the luggage was
taken upstairs. The door closed behind the bellboy.
For the first time Penny and Mrs. Deline were left
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a cheap, dirty hotel!&rdquo; the widow exclaimed
petulantly. &ldquo;And I do hate to share a room with
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny busied herself unpacking her over-night bag.
Crossing to the window, she raised it half way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do put that down!&rdquo; Mrs. Deline ordered. &ldquo;I
detest air blowing directly on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny lowered the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Mrs. Deline smoked a cigarette, carelessly allowing
the ashes to fall on the bed. Getting up, she moved
nervously about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place is so small it seems like a prison,&rdquo; she
complained. &ldquo;Why do you sit there and stare at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize I was staring,&rdquo; Penny apologized.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ll go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Undressing quickly, she crawled beneath the covers.
Mrs. Deline smoked still another cigarette and
then began to prepare for bed. As she removed the
jacket of her suit, Penny noticed that the woman
wore a beautiful jade elephant pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what an attractive ornament!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Is it a locket or just a pin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought it in China,&rdquo; the widow answered without
replying to the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In China! Have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Mrs. Deline gave Penny an amused
glance. Without removing the pin or offering to
show it to the girl, she completed her preparations
for bed.</p>
<p>Just at that moment there came a light tap on the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny!&rdquo; Mr. Parker called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad, what is it?&rdquo; Penny leaped out of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about the car keys,&rdquo; he called through
the transom. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t by chance see them after
we left the dining room?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Penny reassured him. &ldquo;You left them
lying on the table. I picked them up and forgot to
tell you. They&rsquo;re here on the dresser. I&rsquo;ll hand them
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never mind. Keep them. I was just afraid
they were lost. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline glanced curiously at the key ring on
the dresser. She remarked that she had not seen
Penny pick it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking to Dad at the time,&rdquo; the girl
replied.</p>
<p>Leaving the keys on the dresser, she leaped into
bed again and settled herself for a comfortable sleep.
Mrs. Deline presently turned out the light and took
the other bed. For a time Penny was annoyed by
voices from the hallway, then all became quiet. She
slept.</p>
<p>Much later Penny awoke. She stirred and rolled
over. The rain had ceased and moonlight was flooding
into the room. A beam fell directly across Mrs.
Deline&rsquo;s bed, revealing a mass of crumpled sheets and
covers.</p>
<p>Penny stared, scarcely believing her eyes. The bed
was empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>A JADE GREEN CHARM</i></h2>
<p>Sitting up in bed, Penny gazed about the room.
Mrs. Deline was not there and her clothes were gone
from the chair where they had been placed earlier
that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; mused the girl.</p>
<p>Jumping out of bed, she darted to the door.
Though it had been carefully locked a few hours
before, the latch now was off.</p>
<p>Thoroughly puzzled, Penny switched on a light
and glanced carefully about. Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s suitcase
remained in the closet, but coat and hat were missing.
And then Penny made an even more disturbing discovery.
The car keys were gone from the dresser!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I know I put those keys on the bureau just
before I went to bed!&rdquo; she told herself in dismay.
&ldquo;Now I wonder if that woman&mdash;&rdquo; Ashamed of her
thoughts, she muttered: &ldquo;Guess I <i>am</i> a suspicious
brat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Deeply mystified, she moved quickly to the window
overlooking the parking lot and filling station.
It was reassuring to see the Parker automobile standing
where her father had left it earlier that night. But
as she stood staring down into the dark, deserted
yard, she was startled to observe a shadowy figure
rounding a corner of the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline!&rdquo; she recognized the woman.</p>
<p>Penny waited only long enough to see that the
widow was walking straight toward the Parker sedan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She intends to steal it!&rdquo; thought the girl. &ldquo;Why
else would she take the keys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snatching dress and coat from a chair, Penny
scrambled into them without taking time to remove
her pajamas. She tucked up the unsightly legs of
the garment and put on her shoes. Thus clad she ran
downstairs through the semi-dark lobby to the side
exit of the hotel.</p>
<p>As she reached the outside door, she heard the blast
of an automobile engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our car!&rdquo; Penny thought, recognizing the
sound of the running motor. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get away before
I can stop her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engine, evidently cold, sputtered a moment,
then died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Hopeful that she might still get there in time, Penny
raced across the parking lot. Reaching the car just
as it started to move backwards, she jerked open the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Startled, the woman released the clutch so suddenly
that the motor died again.</p>
<p><a href="#front">&ldquo;Where are you taking our car?&rdquo; Penny demanded</a>,
sliding into the seat beside the widow.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s unexpected arrival seemed to completely
unnerve Mrs. Deline. She lost composure, but only
for an instant. Lighting a cigarette, she gazed at
Penny with cold disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had intended to go for a little ride,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Any objections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question placed Penny on the defensive. &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t have taken the car without asking Dad,&rdquo; she
said stiffly. &ldquo;We barely have enough gasoline to
reach Sunset Beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had no thought of going far. I&rsquo;ll just drive
a few miles and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time of night? It must be nearly two
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always enjoy night driving. Particularly if I
am nervous and unable to sleep. Now run back to
bed like a good child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not like the widow&rsquo;s tone of voice. She
liked it less that Mrs. Deline ignored her hint that the
car was not to be used. More than ever she was convinced
that the woman had intended to steal the
automobile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I must ask you not
to take the car without Dad&rsquo;s permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Mrs. Deline exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;You
expect me to rap on your father&rsquo;s door at this time of
night to ask if I may use the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you need to use the car at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s tone was scornful.
&ldquo;Well, let me tell you this! I&rsquo;ve already given
you as much of an explanation as I intend to! I need
the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you only intended to go for a
little drive&mdash;to quiet your nerves,&rdquo; Penny reminded
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant.&rdquo; Mrs. Deline tossed her
cigarette through the open window and stepped on
the car starter. &ldquo;I intend to go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, equally determined, switched off the ignition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how dare you!&rdquo; Mrs. Deline turned furiously
upon the girl. &ldquo;In all my life I never met such
a spoiled child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, but I can&rsquo;t allow you to
take the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline swung open the door on Penny&rsquo;s side
of the seat. She reached as if to push the girl out of
the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Just then a man stepped from one of the hotel garages.
Obviously he had been listening to the conversation,
for he deliberately approached the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong here?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Penny recognized one of the night hotel clerks.
She began to tell him of the disagreement between
herself and Mrs. Deline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This child doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talking about!&rdquo;
the widow declared irritably. &ldquo;Mr. Parker doesn&rsquo;t
mind if I use the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then please ask him!&rdquo; Penny challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not allow me to do it for you,&rdquo; the hotel
clerk offered. &ldquo;Wait here and I&rsquo;ll call Mr. Parker.
He can settle the entire matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t bother him,&rdquo; Mrs. Deline decided suddenly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind anyhow. After such
a commotion I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, I&rsquo;d prefer to call Mr. Parker,&rdquo; said
the hotel man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; urged Penny in deep satisfaction. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to bed,&rdquo; Mrs. Deline announced,
getting out of the car.</p>
<p>She followed the hotel clerk into the building. Left
in possession of the car, Penny reparked it and locked
the doors. Then, feeling a trifle uneasy, she sauntered
into the hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The lobby was deserted. Penny climbed the stairs,
and in the hallway leading to her room, met her father
and the hotel clerk. Summoned from bed, Mr. Parker
garbed in dressing gown and slippers, looked more
annoyed than alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, what is this I hear?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
get the straight of the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Well, it was this way,
Dad. I awakened and discovered that Mrs. Deline
had disappeared with the car keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think she meant to steal the car. But she
explained that she only intended to borrow it for a
night ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny regarded her father in blank amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad, would you borrow another person&rsquo;s
car without asking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but Mrs. Deline probably didn&rsquo;t stop to consider
the matter. No doubt she was too thoughtful
to awaken you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoughtful, my left eye! Dad, I&rsquo;m sure Mrs.
Deline meant to steal the car. Either that or she had
a very important appointment&mdash;a meeting with someone
she wasn&rsquo;t willing to tell us about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Mr. Parker exclaimed impatiently.
&ldquo;Penny, you made a serious mistake in refusing to
allow Mrs. Deline to use the car. She is our guest
and I&rsquo;m afraid you were rude.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must apologize to her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not answer for a moment. She bent
to tie her flapping shoe strings and took her time at
the task. When she straightened, she said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dad. If you say so, I&rsquo;ll apologize. But
I don&rsquo;t think I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not discuss it now, Penny. Suppose you
turn the car keys over to me and go to your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave up the keys and without another word
went down the hall. Tears stung her eyes, but she
brushed them away. She knew she had been unpleasant
to Mrs. Deline. Nevertheless, she felt that her
father had not been entirely just in his attitude.</p>
<p>Entering the bedroom, she hesitated before turning
on the light. Mrs. Deline had undressed and was in
bed. She ignored the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I made a bad mistake,&rdquo; Penny began
awkwardly. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline rolled over in bed. Her dark eyes
flashed and she made no effort to hide her dislike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you admit it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Well, we will forget
the matter. Do not speak of it to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence Penny undressed and hung up her coat
and dress. As she prepared to snap out the light, she
noticed that Mrs. Deline still wore the jade elephant
charm about her neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid you&rsquo;ll break the chain?&rdquo; she
asked before she thought. &ldquo;You forgot to take it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline raised herself on an elbow, fairly glaring
at Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly worry about your own affairs?&rdquo;
she asked insolently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had about all I can take
from you in one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mean anything personal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; said Mrs. Deline with emphasis.</p>
<p>Penny turned out the light and crept into her own
bed. She felt beaten and hurt. It was easy to understand
why Mrs. Deline disliked her, but her own attitude
was bewildering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distrusted the woman the instant I met her,&rdquo; she
reflected. &ldquo;Perhaps I had no reason for it at first.
Now I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny rolled over to face the window. Moonlight
was flooding into the room. In the diffused light the
girl could see Mrs. Deline plainly. The woman had
propped herself up in bed and was fingering the jade
green elephant charm which hung on its slender chain.
Though Penny could not be certain, she thought the
lid of the figure lay open and that Mrs. Deline quickly
snapped it shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Mrs. Deline,&rdquo; she ventured, still trying
to make amends.</p>
<p>The widow did not answer. Instead she turned her
back and pretended to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>NO CAMPING ALLOWED</i></h2>
<p>Breakfast the next morning was a trying ordeal
for Penny. Over the coffee cups Mr. Parker
apologized to Mrs. Deline for what he termed his
daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;inexcusable behavior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow responded graciously, quite in contrast
to her attitude of the previous night. Without saying
much, she conveyed the impression that Penny had
been completely in the wrong, and was in fact, a
spoiled child who must be humored.</p>
<p>The journey on to Sunset Beach was equally unpleasant.
Mr. Parker and Mrs. Deline seemed so absorbed
in animated conversation, that they scarcely
spoke or noticed Penny. Wedged between the luggage
and the camping equipment, she indulged in self
pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least we&rsquo;ll get rid of Mrs. Deline when we
reach Sunset Beach,&rdquo; she cheered herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Presently the car rounded a wide curve in the road,
and Penny caught her first glimpse of the seashore.
Big waves were rolling in, washing an endless stretch
of white sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it beautiful!&rdquo; she exclaimed, brightening.
&ldquo;I wish we were camping right on the beach
instead of in the State Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear the authorities wouldn&rsquo;t permit that,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker laughed. &ldquo;By the way, Penny, is your heart
really set on this camping trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave him a quick look. &ldquo;Yes, it is, Dad,&rdquo;
she said briefly. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was thinking that we&rsquo;d be a lot more comfortable
at one of the big hotels. We&rsquo;d be right on
the beach and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just talking when I said I&rsquo;d like to camp
on the beach,&rdquo; Penny cut in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the State Forest
much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go there just as we planned,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker said, sighing. &ldquo;But you know I never was cut
out for a rough and tumble life, Penny. I&rsquo;m far from
sure I&rsquo;ll make a good camper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car rolled on along the ocean road, presently
entering the little village of Sunset Beach. Normally
a tourist center, the town now was practically deserted,
and the Parkers had chosen it because it was
within easy driving distance of Riverview. Nearly
all of the fine hotels along the water front were
closed. However, the Crystal Inn remained in operation,
and it was there that Mrs. Deline had engaged
a suite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>The car swung into the driveway and halted in
front of the hotel. An attendant did not come immediately
so Mr. Parker himself unloaded the widow&rsquo;s
luggage. Mrs. Deline gave him a dazzling smile as
she bade him goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll not say goodbye just yet,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
corrected. &ldquo;Penny and I will camp only a short distance
away. We&rsquo;ll run down to the beach often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Deline. &ldquo;I have no friends here
and I&rsquo;ll be happy to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker carried the widow&rsquo;s luggage into the
hotel. While he was absent, Penny moved up to the
front seat. She tuned in a radio program, listening
to it with growing impatience. Finally her father
sauntered out of the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nearly gave you up,&rdquo; Penny remarked pointedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker slid behind the steering wheel and
started the car. When they were driving along the
ocean front road he said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I can&rsquo;t imagine what has come over you
lately. You&rsquo;re not in the least like the little girl who
was my pal and companion. Why have you been so
unkind to Mrs. Deline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; Penny said flatly. &ldquo;Furthermore,
I distrust her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve acted very stupid and silly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;re ashamed of me,&rdquo; Penny replied
glaring at her own reflection in the car mirror. &ldquo;At
any rate, I saved the car for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That accusation was ridiculous, Penny. Mrs.
Deline is a wealthy woman who could buy herself
a dozen cars in ordinary times. She merely gave in to
a sudden whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you know about Mrs. Deline, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a great deal,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted. &ldquo;I met
her at the club. She served as a special War correspondent
in China, I believe. She has traveled all over
the world and speaks a half dozen languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of her until she came to Riverview,&rdquo;
Penny said with a sniff. &ldquo;Nor did I ever see any of
her writing in print. If you ask me, she&rsquo;s a phony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not discuss the subject further,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
replied, losing patience. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re older, I hope
you&rsquo;ll learn to be more gracious and charitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny subsided into hurt silence. In all her life she
could recall only a few occasions when her father had
spoken so sternly to her. Close to tears, she studied
the tumbling surface of the ocean with concentrated
interest.</p>
<p>In silence the Parkers drove through the village,
stopping at a filling station to inquire the way to Rhett
State Forest. Supplies were purchased at one of the
stores, and by that time it was noon. At Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
suggestion they stopped at a roadside inn for lunch.
After that they drove on a half mile beyond the outskirts
of Sunset Beach, past a tall lighthouse to the
end of the pavement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We follow a dirt road for a quarter of a mile to
Bradley Knoll,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said, consulting directions
he had jotted down on an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mud road, you mean,&rdquo; Penny corrected, peering
ahead at the narrow, twisting highway. &ldquo;It really
rained here last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car had no chains. Not without misgiving,
Mr. Parker drove off the pavement onto the slippery
road. The car wallowed about and at times skidded
dangerously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we reach the State park we&rsquo;ll have gravel
roads,&rdquo; Penny said, studying a map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If</i> we get there,&rdquo; Mr. Parker corrected.</p>
<p>Barely had he spoken than the car went out of
control. It took a long skid, turned crosswise in the
road, and then the rear wheels slipped into a deep
ditch. Opening the car door, Penny saw that the car
was bogged down to the hub caps.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker tried without success to pull out of the
ditch. Alighting, he inspected the rear wheels which
had spun deeper and deeper into the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance to get out of here without help,&rdquo;
he said crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to find someone to give us
a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Farther down the road stood a weatherbeaten farmhouse.
Penny offered to go there to summon help,
but her father insisted upon doing it himself. He
presently returned with a farmer and a small tractor.
After considerable difficulty the car was pulled out
of the ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do I owe you?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amount seemed far too high for the service
rendered, but Mr. Parker paid it without comment.
His shoes were caked with mud, and so were the
trouser legs of his suit. Only by an effort of will did
he keep his temper under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figurin&rsquo; on camping in the Rhett Forest?&rdquo; the
farmer asked Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Is it much farther?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little piece down the road. You&rsquo;ll strike
gravel at the next corner. You can make it if you&rsquo;re
careful. I don&rsquo;t calculate you&rsquo;ll have much fun camping
in the Park though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a lot o&rsquo; rain lately. The mosquitoes
are bitin&rsquo; something fierce. And the ground&rsquo;s mighty
damp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a floor to our tent,&rdquo; Penny said optimistically.
&ldquo;I think camping will be fun. I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>The farmer started the tractor. &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t let
me discourage you,&rdquo; he shrugged. &ldquo;So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker rejoined Penny in the car. &ldquo;Why not
call this whole thing off?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;We could
go to the hotel and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad! You promised me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Penny, if that&rsquo;s the way you feel, but I
know we&rsquo;re asking for punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By careful driving the Parkers reached the gravel
road without mishap. At the entrance to the Rhett
Park area they were stopped by a pleasant, middle-aged
forest ranger who took down the license number
of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful about your camp fire,&rdquo; he instructed.
&ldquo;Only last week several acres of timber were destroyed
at Alton. We&rsquo;re not certain whether it was
started by a camper or was a case of sabotage. In any
case, one can&rsquo;t be too careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be,&rdquo; promised Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camp only in the designated sites,&rdquo; the ranger
added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around later on to see how you&rsquo;re
getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once beyond the gateway arch, Penny&rsquo;s sagging
spirits began to revive. The road curled lazily between
dense masses of timber fringed by artistic old-fashioned
rail fences. Numerous signs pointed to
trails that invited exploration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, it&rsquo;s really nice here!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have a wonderful time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the car came to an open space with picnic
tables. There was a picturesque spot beside a rocky
brook which looked just right for a camp site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pitch our tent here!&rdquo; pleaded Penny. &ldquo;You
set it up while I cook supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker unloaded the car and went to work with
a will hammering the metal stakes of the umbrella tent.
Penny busied herself sorting pots and pans and trying
to get the gasoline stove started. Despite her best
efforts she could not induce it to burn.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mr. Parker was having his own
set of troubles. Three of the tent stakes were missing.
Twice he put up the umbrella framework, only to
have the entire structure collapse upon his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, come here and help me!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had about enough of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ran to her father&rsquo;s rescue, pulling the canvas
from his head and shoulders. By working together
they finally got the tent set up. Another half hour
was required to put up the cots and make them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that job is done,&rdquo; Mr. Parker sighed, collapsing
on one of the beds. &ldquo;Such a life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I hate to bother you,&rdquo; Penny apologized,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t start the stove. Do you mind looking
at it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Grumbling a bit, Mr. Parker went to tinker with
the stove. Three-quarters of an hour slipped away
before he succeeded in coaxing a bright flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this work has given me a big appetite for
supper,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;What are we having,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot the salt though,&rdquo; Penny confessed, slapping
the meat into a frying pan.</p>
<p>The burner was too hot. While Penny had her
back turned and was opening a can of beans, the
steaks began to scorch. Mr. Parker tried to rescue
them. In his haste he seized the hot skillet handle
and burned his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; Penny sympathized. &ldquo;I
guess the steaks are practically ruined too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else to eat?&rdquo; the publisher asked, nursing
his blistered hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beans!&rdquo; Mr. Parker repeated with bitter emphasis.
&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;dish them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was serving the food on tin plates when a
car drove up and stopped. A ranger climbed out and
walked over to the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea, camping here?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you read signs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see any sign,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>The ranger pointed to one in plain sight tacked on
the trunk of a tree. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Restricted Area. No Camping Permitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; the ranger added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father gazed at each other in despair.
After all the work they had done, it didn&rsquo;t seem as
though they could break camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any objections if we stay here until morning?&rdquo;
Mr. Parker requested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a pretty hard time
of it getting established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranger looked sympathetic but unmoved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;Regulations are regulations.
You may finish your supper if you like, then
you must move on. The regular camp site is a quarter
of a mile farther up the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>OVER THE AIR</i></h2>
<p>The ranger&rsquo;s order so discouraged Penny and
her father that they lost all zest for supper. Too
weary for conversation, they tore up the beds, repacked
the dishes, and pulled the tent stakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not worked so hard in years,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
sighed. &ldquo;What a mistake to call this a vacation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it won&rsquo;t be so hard once we get settled,&rdquo;
Penny said hopefully. &ldquo;After all, we&rsquo;ve had more
than our share of bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bad luck, however, continued to follow the campers.
In the gathering darkness, Penny and her father
had trouble finding the specified camp ground. It
was impossible to drive a car into the cleared space,
so they were forced to carry all of the heavy luggage
and equipment from the automobile to the camp site.</p>
<p>By that time it was quite dark. Mr. Parker misplaced
one of the tent stakes and could not find it
without a lengthy search. As he finally drove it in,
he hammered his thumb instead of the metal pin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drat it all! I&rsquo;ve had enough of this!&rdquo; he muttered
irritably. &ldquo;Penny, why not give it up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Dad!&rdquo; Penny cut in quickly. &ldquo;Once we
get the tent up again, we&rsquo;ll be all right. Here, I&rsquo;ll
hold the flashlight so you can see better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally the tent was successfully staked down,
though Mr. Parker temporarily abandoned the idea of
putting up the front porch. Penny set up the cots
again and made the beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you packed plenty of woolen blankets,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker commented, shivering. &ldquo;It will be cold
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny admitted that she had brought only two
thin ones for each bed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose it could
get so cold on a summer night,&rdquo; she confessed ruefully.</p>
<p>Worn by his strenuous labors, Mr. Parker climbed
into the closed car to smoke a cigar. Penny, finding
the dark tent lonesome, soon joined him there. She
switched on the car radio, tuning in an orchestra.
Presently it went off the air so she dialed another
station. A strange jargon of words which could not
be understood, accosted her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold that, Penny!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What station can it be?&rdquo; Penny speculated, peering
at the luminous dial. &ldquo;It sounds like a short wave
broadcast. Must be a station off its wave band.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>She and her father listened intently to the speaker
who had a resonant, baritone voice. Not a word of
the broadcast could they understand. Obviously a
message was being sent in code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, that sounds like the same station I heard yesterday!&rdquo;
Penny broke in. &ldquo;Where can it be located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced quickly at her father. His remark,
she thought, had definite significance. Before she
could question him, the strange jargon ceased. The
deep baritone voice concluded in plain, slightly accented
English: &ldquo;This is the Voice from the Cave,
signing off until tomorrow night. Stand by, Comrades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was no regular station,&rdquo; Penny declared,
puzzled. &ldquo;But what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker reached over to turn off the panel
switch. &ldquo;It was an outlaw station,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;The authorities have been after it for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you learn about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through various channels. Most outlaw radio
stations can be traced quite easily by the use of modern
radio-detecting devices. The enemy agent who
operates this station is a particularly elusive fellow.
Just when the police are sure they have him, he moves
to another locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was silent a moment and then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know quite a bit about this mysterious
Voice, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally I&rsquo;ve been interested in the case. If the
police catch the fellow it will make a good story for
the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the station thought to be located, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it moves nightly. The fellow obviously has
a portable broadcasting outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t the general locality known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled as he knocked ashes from his
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Authorities seem to think that it may be somewhere
near here. Sunset Beach has countless caves,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; The information excited Penny. &ldquo;You
never told me that before, Dad. And I suspect that
you&rsquo;re keeping a lot of other secrets from me too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunset Beach&rsquo;s caves are no secret. They&rsquo;re part
of the tourist attraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same you never mentioned them, Dad. I
thought it was odd that you chose this place for a
vacation. Now I&rsquo;m beginning to catch on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker pretended not to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true that you came here to do a bit of investigation
work?&rdquo; Penny pursued the subject relentlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t try to pin me down,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
laughed. &ldquo;Suppose we just say we came here for a
vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Penny eyed her father quizzically. From the way
he sidestepped her questions she was certain that he
had more than a casual interest in the outlaw radio
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, will you let me help you?&rdquo; she pleaded
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me?&rdquo; Mr. Parker joked. &ldquo;Why, you seem
to think that I&rsquo;m a Government investigator in disguise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deny that you came here largely because
of your interest in that station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I may be a tiny bit interested. But don&rsquo;t
jump to conclusions, young lady! It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
follow that I have set out to track down any
enemy agent single handed.&rdquo; Mr. Parker brought
the discussion to an end by opening the car door.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead tired, Penny. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ll
turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her father had gone to the tent, Penny remained
for a while in the car. Soberly she stared at
the stars and thought over what she had learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what Dad says,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;he
came here to find that radio station! But maybe, just
maybe, I&rsquo;ll beat him to it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>BREAKFAST BLUES</i></h2>
<p>Penny awoke next morning to find the tent
cold and damp. She rolled over on the hard cot and
moaned with pain. Every muscle in her battered
body felt as if it had been twisted into a knot.</p>
<p>Swinging her feet to the canvas floor, she pulled
away the curtain to peer at her father&rsquo;s cot. It was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve overslept,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Hope Dad&rsquo;s
started breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny dressed quickly, cringing as she pulled on
damp shirt and shorts. Dew lay heavy upon the tent
and the grass outside was saturated. She walked gingerly
as she picked her way toward the parked car.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker had set up a portable table nearby and
was tinkering with the gasoline stove. He was unshaven
and looked very much out of sorts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Dad!&rdquo; Penny greeted him with as much cheer
as she could muster. &ldquo;What are we having for breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, so far as I can see! This stove is on
strike again. I&rsquo;ve tried for half an hour to get it
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny climbed into the car to use the mirror. The
sight of her face horrified her. One cheek was
blotched with ugly red mosquito bites, there were
dark circles under her eyes, and her hair hung in
strings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone ever gets me on another camping trip
I&rsquo;ll be surprised!&rdquo; Mr. Parker exclaimed. He slammed
the stove down on the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through monkeying
with this contrary beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, such a temper,&rdquo; Penny chided, giggling
despite her own discouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you suggest how we&rsquo;re to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s cold breakfast food with canned
milk.&rdquo; Penny burrowed deep in a box of supplies
stored in the car. &ldquo;Two soft bananas. No coffee,
I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Mr. Parker said grimly. &ldquo;Well,
bring on the bird food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny set the table and dished up the dry breakfast
cereal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least we have beautiful scenery,&rdquo; she remarked
as she sat down to the dismal repast with her father.
&ldquo;Just look at those grand old trees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The place is all right. It&rsquo;s camping that has me
tied in a knot. Now at the Crystal Inn we could
be comfortable&mdash;right on the beach too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Penny said, though not very firmly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
like it here after we get adjusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need any supplies today?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to have fresh meat and milk. I
forgot salt too and bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive down to Sunset Beach and get the things.
May as well take the stove along too and try to have
it repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be a good idea,&rdquo; Penny admitted,
though with reluctance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be gone long, will
you? I thought we might explore some of the trails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s plenty of time for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker was noticeably cheerful as he stowed
the portable stove in the car and drove away. Not
without misgiving Penny watched him go. She remained
somewhat troubled as she washed the breakfast
dishes at the brook and struggled with the beds.
The camping trip hadn&rsquo;t worked out as she had hoped
and expected. So far it had been all work and no fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad was up to something when he skipped out
of here so fast,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Wonder why he doesn&rsquo;t
come back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The sun rose high above the trees, drying the grass
and tent. Penny went for a short hike in the woods.
She returned to find that her father still had not returned.</p>
<p>Just then a car rattled up the twisting road. Recognizing
the same ranger who had caused so much
trouble the previous night, Penny prepared herself
for further blows. However, the government man
was all smiles as he pulled up not far from the umbrella
tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just dropped by to see if you&rsquo;re getting along all
right,&rdquo; he greeted her in a friendly way. &ldquo;Everything
Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t venture such a rash statement as that,&rdquo;
Penny answered, her face downcast.</p>
<p>Because the ranger, whose name was Bill Atkins,
seemed to have a genuine interest, she found herself
telling him all about her troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve not had a decent meal since you
came here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, climbing out of the car.
&ldquo;Maybe I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you wave a magic wand and produce hot
food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; laughed the ranger. &ldquo;Gasoline stoves
are more bother than they&rsquo;re worth in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny watched in amazed admiration he built
a good fire which soon made a bed of glowing cherry
red coals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about a nice pan of fish fried to a crisp
brown?&rdquo; the ranger tempted her. &ldquo;I caught a string
of them this morning. Beauties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the car he brought a basket of fat trout, already
dressed and ready for cooking. Without asking
Penny for anything, he wrapped them in corn
meal, salted each fish and let it sizzle in hot butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always travel with your car equipped like
a kitchen cabinet?&rdquo; Penny joked. Crouching beside
the fire, she barely could take her eyes from the food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; the ranger laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on
an overnight trip. Usually have the fixings of a meal
with me though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the fish slowly sizzled, Bill put on a pot of
coffee and fried potatoes. He accomplished everything
with such ease that Penny could only watch
dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you and your father considered me an old
crab last night,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Sometimes we hate
to enforce the rules, but we have to treat everyone
alike. If we allowed folks to camp wherever they
pleased the danger of forest fire would be greatly
increased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, of course. Have you had any fires
this season?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here.&rdquo; Deftly the ranger dished up the potatoes
and crisply browned fish. &ldquo;Plenty of them farther
South. Not all caused by carelessness of campers
either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Penny was quick to seize upon the remark. &ldquo;Sabotage?&rdquo;
she questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we think,&rdquo; the ranger nodded. He
poured two cups of steaming, black coffee. &ldquo;Fact is,
enemy agents have made quite a few attempts to set
fire to our forests. Nearly always they&rsquo;re caught,
but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we dare let up our vigilance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ate every morsel of the food, praising the
ranger highly for his cooking ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Dad could have had some of this fish,&rdquo; she
added. &ldquo;He went down to Sunset Beach for supplies
and for some reason hasn&rsquo;t returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be on the road myself,&rdquo; the ranger declared,
getting up from the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m due in town
at twelve o&rsquo;clock and it&rsquo;s nearly that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re driving to Sunset Beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, want to ride along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny debated briefly. &ldquo;Wait until I get my coat,&rdquo;
she requested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonesome here alone. Anyway,
I want to learn what&rsquo;s keeping Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The park road had dried considerably, but even so
the car skidded from side to side until it reached the
paved highway. At Sunset Beach, the ranger dropped
Penny off at the postoffice. Rather at a loss to know
what to do with herself, she wandered about the half-deserted
streets in search of her father. He was not
at any of the stores, nor did inquiry reveal his whereabouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s sunning himself on the beach,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>A boardwalk led over the dunes to the water front.
The tide was at ebb, revealing a long, wide stretch
of white sand strewn with shells and seaweed. Penny
paused to gaze meditatively upon the wind-swept sea.
For a time she watched the waves break and spill their
foam on the sandy shore. Then she walked slowly
on toward the imposing Crystal Inn.</p>
<p>Approaching the private beach area, Penny met
only a few persons, mostly soldiers on furlough with
their girls. There were no bathers for a sharp, cool
wind blew off the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunset Beach is nice,&rdquo; thought Penny, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Crystal Inn there was more activity. Tennis
courts were in use and so was the swimming pool.
Penny circled the well-kept grounds, not intending
to enter the building. However, as she drew near,
her attention was drawn to the flagstone terrace overlooking
the formal garden. Though it was set with
tables there were not many diners.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny stopped short, scarcely believing
her eyes. At one of the tables near the stone railing
sat her father with Mrs. Deline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>THE BEARDED STRANGER</i></h2>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s first thought upon seeing her father
and Mrs. Deline was to steal quietly away. Then
amazement and injury gave way to a feeling of indignation.
Perhaps her father had a perfect right to
lunch with Mrs. Deline, but it was inconsiderate of
him to so completely forget his own daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might just as well be an orphan!&rdquo; Penny sighed.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stiffly she marched across the lawn to the railed-in
hotel veranda. Her father saw her coming. His look
of surprise changed to one of guarded welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up and have lunch with us,&rdquo; he invited.
&ldquo;The food here is quite an improvement on what
we&rsquo;ve been having at camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could find no outside entranceway to the
terrace. To Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s horror and her father&rsquo;s
amusement, she climbed over the stone railing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Penny began, ignoring the widow except
for a curt nod, &ldquo;I was just about ready to get out a
search warrant for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker drew another chair to the table for his
daughter. Her hair was none too well combed, she
wore no stockings, and the coat did not entirely cover
her camp costume. By contrast Mrs. Deline was perfectly
turned out in tailored tweed suit with a smart
little hat of feathers. Though the woman said nothing,
her gaze was scornful as she appraised Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I order for you?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked,
signaling a waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, thank you.&rdquo; Penny was coldly polite.
&ldquo;I had a very fine lunch at camp, thanks to one of the
rangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t get back,&rdquo; Mr. Parker apologized.
&ldquo;It took a long while to have the stove repaired.
Then I met Mrs. Deline and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand,&rdquo; Penny broke in. &ldquo;The point
is, when, if ever, are you coming back to camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, right now I suppose. We&rsquo;ve finished our
luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter had come to the table. Mr. Parker
asked for the bill, paid it, and arose. As he bade Mrs.
Deline goodbye, he remarked that he probably would
see her again soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Walking to the hotel parking lot where Mr. Parker
had left the car, neither he nor Penny had much to
say. Not until they were driving through the village
was the subject of Mrs. Deline mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t be a bit nicer to her,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker commented. &ldquo;You scarcely spoke a word
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say anything to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve treated Mrs. Deline just as well as she treats
me!&rdquo; Penny defended herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit I don&rsquo;t like
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you show it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do, but she has no business taking so
much of your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where the shoe pinches,&rdquo; chuckled Mr.
Parker. &ldquo;My little girl is jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline is brilliant&mdash;a highly educated woman
and I enjoy talking to her,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I assure you it&rsquo;s no more serious than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny moved close to her father and squeezed his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been pals for such a long while,&rdquo; she said
wistfully. &ldquo;If anything ever should come between
us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;re positively morbid!&rdquo; her father interrupted.
&ldquo;Of course nothing ever will come between
us! Now let&rsquo;s talk of more cheerful subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking, Penny. You need a friend,
someone to pal around with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only friend I need, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean someone your own age, Penny. Why not
send for Louise Sidell? I&rsquo;ll gladly pay her train fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fun having Lou here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled. We&rsquo;ll send a wire now.&rdquo; Mr.
Parker turned the car around and drove to the local
telegraph office.</p>
<p>Before Penny could change her mind, the message
was sent. Not until long after she and her father had
returned to the park did it occur to her that unwittingly
she might have fashioned her own undoing.
Though camping would be far more interesting with
Louise to share her experiences, it also would give her
father added opportunity to see Mrs. Deline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t think of that angle,&rdquo; Penny reflected
uneasily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following day Mr. Parker spent the entire day
in camp. With the gasoline stove in working order,
hot meals were prepared though not without endless
effort. There were dishes to wash, beds to make, and
by the time the tasks were done, neither Penny nor
her father had any energy left for hiking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>The second day was much easier. However, with
more free time, Mr. Parker became increasingly restless.
He missed his morning paper and was dissatisfied
with the skimpy news reports that came in over
the radio. Penny was not surprised when he mentioned
that he would walk down to Sunset Beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind if I go with you?&rdquo; Penny asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; her father answered. &ldquo;Why
should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Sunset Beach a call at the local telegraph office
disclosed a message for Penny which had been held
for lack of an address. The wire was from Louise
and read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;ARRIVING AT SUNSET BEACH THURSDAY
ON THE 12:30 PLANE. HOLD EVERYTHING.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursday!&rdquo; Penny cried, offering the telegram to
her father. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s tomorrow! My, will I be glad
to see Lou! This place has been like a morgue without
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine the town will brighten up quite a bit
within the next few days,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said, a twinkle
in his eye. &ldquo;In fact, Louise may not be the only new
arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is someone else coming to see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker would not answer her many questions.
&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>Since arriving at Sunset Beach Penny had been
eager to visit the lighthouse located on Crag Point.
Noticing that the tide was low, she suggested to her
father that they go there together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too long a walk,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;You run along
by yourself. I&rsquo;ll sun myself on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving her father, Penny started off alone. The
sun was warm and there were a number of bathers
splashing about in the surf. A long row of picturesque
cottages lined the water front. They thinned
out as she went farther up the beach, and presently
there were no habitations, only desolate, wind-blown
sand.</p>
<p>Midway to the lighthouse, Penny met a man of
early middle age who carried fishing rod and creel.
He stared at her, hesitated, then paused to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice you&rsquo;re going toward Crag Point,&rdquo; he remarked
pleasantly. &ldquo;Are you a stranger to this locality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny admitted that she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you haven&rsquo;t been told that the Point
is a dangerous place to be at high tide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I hadn&rsquo;t heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Point is very nearly covered at that time,&rdquo;
the stranger explained. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger at the
present moment, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will I have here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, several hours,&rdquo; the stranger replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no cause for alarm if you just keep watch of the
tide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Penny thanked the stranger and walked on toward
the lighthouse. The structure rose to a height of
seventy-five feet above the beach and was reached by
means of a narrow little iron stairway.</p>
<p>No one was about the premises as Penny approached.
However, as she started up the iron steps,
a door far above her head opened. A burly, stout
man whose face was browned by wind and sun,
peered down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come up here!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;No visitors
are allowed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Penny murmured, retreating a step. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know. I only wanted to see the tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No visitors,&rdquo; the keeper of the light repeated.
&ldquo;War regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rule seemed a reasonable one, but after such
a long hike, Penny was disappointed. Walking back
to the main section of the beach, she looked about
for her father. He had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie he&rsquo;s at the Crystal Inn!&rdquo; she
thought indignantly.</p>
<p>But Penny could not find her father there nor at
any other place along the water front. After an
hour&rsquo;s search she decided that he must have returned
to camp. Returning there, she approached the tent,
noticing that the flap was closed, though not buttoned
as she had left it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad must be here,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Drawing nearer she could see movement within the
tent as someone brushed against the canvas walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>There was no answer. But the next instant a man
in rough garments and straw hat rushed out of the
tent. Penny never before had set eyes upon him.
She was so astonished that she gained only a fleeting
impression of the bearded stranger. Seeing her, he
thrust some object beneath his coat and fled into the
woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>KEEPER OF THE LIGHT</i></h2>
<p>Recovering from astonishment, Penny darted
to the tent and jerked open the flap. The beds had
been torn apart. Her purse, hidden beneath the pillow,
was gone. Suitcases lay open on the canvas
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man was a thief!&rdquo; she thought angrily.</p>
<p>Too late, she tried to determine which direction he
had taken. She could hear no sound of crackling
leaves or running feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying low,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;No use chasing
him. I never could find him among the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoroughly incensed, she went back to the disordered
tent. A preliminary check revealed that besides
the pocketbook, a pair of her father&rsquo;s shoes and
a sweater had been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky I didn&rsquo;t have much money in my purse,&rdquo;
Penny congratulated herself. &ldquo;It was a good leather
pocketbook though, and I hate to lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Going outside, she discovered other losses. The
supply of groceries had been ransacked. Bread was
gone, several oranges and a tin of cold meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow was hungry,&rdquo; Penny reflected.
&ldquo;Probably some shiftless person who isn&rsquo;t willing to
work for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the tent again, she busied herself making
the beds and repacking the suitcases. As she finished
the task, she heard footsteps outside. Fearful that
the thief had returned, she jerked open the canvas
flap. It was her father who had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
rushing out to meet him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told him how she had frightened away the
bearded stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said, frowning. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
suppose there was another camper within miles of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man didn&rsquo;t look like a camper, Dad. He
wore dirty, mussed clothing and a beard of at least
a week&rsquo;s growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old a fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he looked young to me. And he ran like
a young person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll report it to the ranger,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said,
entering the tent to check over his belongings.
&ldquo;Probably never will get any of our things back
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ranger may know who the fellow is, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted. &ldquo;Penny,
I&rsquo;m glad Louise is coming tomorrow. I certainly
don&rsquo;t like the idea of your remaining here in camp
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you stay with me?&rdquo; Penny countered
instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m planning on being rather busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Mrs. Deline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;re impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you with her today? I looked everywhere
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline and I did go for a little walk. No
harm in that, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all depends upon your viewpoint,&rdquo; Penny said
loftily. &ldquo;Personally, I consider her about as harmless
as a Grade A rattler!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, enough of such talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she returned grimly, &ldquo;but never say I
didn&rsquo;t warn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to tell you,&rdquo; Mr. Parker resumed,
&ldquo;that I expect to be busy the next few days helping
local authorities trace that outlaw radio station we
heard on the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, Army experts are being sent here to aid
in the work. My days will be pretty well tied up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Dad,&rdquo; Penny said contritely. &ldquo;Naturally
I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your trouble is that you don&rsquo;t stop to
think,&rdquo; Mr. Parker lectured. &ldquo;Please, will you forget
Mrs. Deline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise not to bother you about her again, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Mr. Parker awkwardly patted his daughter&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;I realize you&rsquo;ve had an unpleasant time
of it so far, Penny. But things should pick up after
Louise arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that other surprise you hinted about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll have to wait and see,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
smiled. &ldquo;However, I promise you that what&rsquo;s coming
really will prove a pleasant surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Penny kept up a running fire of questions,
her father would tell her no more. From a few hints
he dropped, she gathered that he was expecting a visitor
within a day or so. That rather disappointed her,
for with the exception of Louise, she could think of
no one she particularly wanted to see at Sunset Beach.</p>
<p>Later that day when a forest ranger stopped at
camp for a few minutes, Mr. Parker reported the
theft of food and clothing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the thief was a young man with a beard?&rdquo; the
ranger pondered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know of anyone in the
area answering such a description. We&rsquo;ll certainly be
on the watch for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father expected to hear no more
from the matter. Toward sundown, however, the
same ranger returned to camp, bringing the missing
pocketbook. It was stripped of money but still contained
a compact and various toilet articles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find the purse?&rdquo; Penny inquired
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Beech Trail not far from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was dropped on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently it was. I followed the trail for a
quarter of mile, then lost the fellow when he took to
the brook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a smart fellow to think of that,&rdquo; commented
Mr. Parker thoughtfully. &ldquo;Perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t
an ordinary snatch-thief after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranger offered no comment. As he turned
to go, he did assure Penny again that every effort
would be made to capture the culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the fellow still is in the park we&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the coming of dusk a penetrating chill settled
over the camp. Even the hot supper of steak and
potatoes that Penny prepared failed to sufficiently
warm the two tenters. They did the dishes and then,
not wishing to go to bed, sought the enclosed car for
heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting to rain,&rdquo; Mr. Parker observed as a few
drops splashed against the windshield. &ldquo;Looks as
if we&rsquo;re in for another siege of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Louise is due tomorrow,&rdquo; Penny sighed.
&ldquo;Unless the weather improves I&rsquo;d not blame her one
bit if she turns right around and starts back to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The rain came down steadily with a promise of
continuing throughout the night. Mr. Parker read a
day-old newspaper by the light in the car, grumbling
because the news was so old. Presently he switched
on the radio, trying without success to tune in the
outlaw station which had been heard previously at
the same hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Reception must be
poor tonight, or the station has changed to another
time. Probably it&rsquo;s shifted to a different locality too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, isn&rsquo;t it true that the operator of that secret
station is an enemy agent?&rdquo; Penny asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not tell me all about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to tell yet, Penny. Confidentially I&rsquo;ll
admit I came here hoping to help State authorities
find the station. So far I&rsquo;ve accomplished nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What clues have you gained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Penny, don&rsquo;t quiz me,&rdquo; Mr. Parker laughed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything as soon as I&rsquo;m free to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, maybe I&rsquo;ll find out for myself!&rdquo;
Penny hinted. Abruptly swinging open the car door,
she bolted through the rain to the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Breakfast the next morning was a more cheerful
meal than had been expected. During the night the
rain had ceased and a hot morning sun soon dried out
the drenched canvas. Mr. Parker prepared coffee,
eggs and bacon, an unbelievable example of perfect
cooking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I didn&rsquo;t think you had it in you!&rdquo; Penny
praised as she sat down on a camp stool beside him.
&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll develop into a real camper after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo; Grinning,
Mr. Parker dropped two plump fried eggs on
his daughter&rsquo;s plate and took the remaining four for
himself. &ldquo;This life could be worse though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, what time shall we start for the airport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker poured himself a cup of coffee and then
answered: &ldquo;Afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to go with you,
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad! Louise will be expecting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me she wants to see,&rdquo; Mr. Parker corrected.
&ldquo;I have an important engagement I can&rsquo;t
break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced quickly up. She was tempted to
ask her father if he intended to see Mrs. Deline. Recalling
that she had made her father a promise, she
wisely withheld comment. Instead she asked if she
might use the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he consented. &ldquo;Just go easy on the
gasoline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast over, dishes were dispatched and the
camp put in order. By eleven o&rsquo;clock Penny and her
father were in Sunset Beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drop me anywhere,&rdquo; Mr. Parker instructed
vaguely.</p>
<p>Leaving her father on a street corner, Penny drove
slowly toward the airport a mile and a quarter away.
There was little travel on the winding highway which
curled along the beach. A government jeep whizzed
past and two soldiers shouted and waved. Penny
waved back.</p>
<p>There was no need to hurry for Louise&rsquo;s plane was
not yet due. Penny took her time and enjoyed the
ocean scenery. The tide was coming in and gulls
free-wheeled over the waves, dipping down at intervals
in search of food.</p>
<p>Gazing along the deserted beach, Penny was startled
to see a familiar feminine figure hastening toward
the lighthouse on Crag Point. The woman wore a
white scarf that half obscured her face, yet the girl
easily recognized her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline!&rdquo; she thought, idling the car. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
certainly going to the lighthouse! I wonder if that
gruff old keeper will drive her away as he did me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to learn what would happen, the girl drew
up at the side of the road. Mrs. Deline was too far
away to observe the automobile. Intent only upon
her own affairs, she walked swiftly along the beach
until she reached the base of the lighthouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to see the fun!&rdquo; chuckled Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The keeper had appeared on the platform and was
gazing down upon the visitor. He called something
to the woman that Penny could not hear. But to her
amazement, Mrs. Deline started up the iron stairway.</p>
<p>Penny waited expectantly. She was certain that
the keeper of the light would order Mrs. Deline away.
Instead, he greeted her with a hearty handshake as if
they were old friends. They entered the lighthouse
tower room together, and the heavy door closed behind
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>A SURPRISE FROM THE SKY</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t strange!&rdquo; Penny muttered. &ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t permitted to set foot inside the lighthouse, but
in goes Mrs. Deline without a single question asked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her curiosity aroused, the girl decided to wait and
watch. Twenty minutes elapsed. During that time
Mrs. Deline did not reappear. Penny grew tired of
her vigil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline evidently intends to stay there a long
while,&rdquo; she thought as she drove on. &ldquo;For all I know,
she and the lighthouse keeper may be old friends.
They did greet each other as if they were acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the airport Penny parked on the crowded lot.
She dropped into the lunch room for a sandwich and
then wandered out on the cement runway. The noon
passenger plane presently was announced through the
loudspeaker system. A moment later Penny glimpsed
the big silver twin-motor transport gliding down over
the tree tops. As it taxied up to unload passengers,
she held her breath. Knowing that there had been
several last-minute cancellation of tickets, she was
afraid that Louise might not be aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>But as the door of the big transport swung back,
her chum was the second passenger to alight. Fresh
and trim in a yellow wool suit, she flung herself into
Penny&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a nice trip, Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavenly! Only it didn&rsquo;t last long enough.
We were here almost before I knew we&rsquo;d started. I
nearly lost my ticket to an Army Major too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you might not get here,&rdquo; Penny
laughed, picking up Louise&rsquo;s light over-night case.
&ldquo;What happened to the Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at the last minute he changed his mind, so the
company decided I could have my ticket back. And
here I am! How&rsquo;s camping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much fun so far,&rdquo; Penny confessed truthfully.
&ldquo;But I can feel things starting to pick up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a wonderful time together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just bet we will!&rdquo; Penny declared with emphasis.
&ldquo;Had anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, lunch was served on the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may as well start for camp. I have
oodles to tell you, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midway to the parking lot, Louise paused, calling
attention to a Flying Fortress that was coming in
against the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s watch it land,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Did you ever
see such a beautiful ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge Fortress came in fast for a perfect landing.
Crew members began to tumble out through
the door. One of the young men in captain&rsquo;s uniform
evidently was a passenger for he carried a suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou!&rdquo; Penny grasped her chum&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;That
flier looks like Jerry Livingston!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I think it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was so excited that she barely could control
her voice. Jerry Livingston was one of her very best
friends, a former reporter on the <i>Riverview Star</i>. In
the days before he had joined the Army Air Force,
she and Jerry had shared many an exciting adventure.
However, since he had gone away there had been
only a few letters and those brief communications
had contained no real news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Jerry!&rdquo; Penny cried an instant later. &ldquo;Oh,
Lou, this must have been the surprise that Dad knew
about! How could he keep it from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking away from her chum, Penny darted across
the runway. As she called Jerry&rsquo;s name, the young
man turned toward her. His handsome, wind-tanned
face became a brilliant smile. A dozen long strides
carried him to her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny!&rdquo; he cried. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate. He just
swept her into his arms and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Penny,&rdquo; Jerry apologized, his eyes twinkling.
&ldquo;Guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. But when
you&rsquo;ve not seen your one and only girl for going on
a year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your which?&rdquo; Penny stammered, too confused to
blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my one and only, you know,&rdquo; Jerry
grinned. &ldquo;Always were for that matter. Even in the
days when we tracked down news stories together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise came hurrying up. Jerry turned to greet
her and the conversation became less personal. But
from the way Louise smiled, Penny knew she had seen
the kiss and would demand lengthy explanations
later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; she cried, noticing the decorations on his
trim uniform. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given you the Distinguished
Flying Cross! And the Purple Heart! You didn&rsquo;t
write a word about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indignantly, the girls pried the story from Jerry.
He had piloted a Flying Fortress in a highly successful
raid over the Romanian oil fields. To reach its
target, the Fortress had flown through flaming refineries,
so low to the ground that fire actually had
leaped up through the bomb bay of the plane.
Swarms of enemy fighter ships had been fought off.
Jerry&rsquo;s plane was one of the few to get back to its
base safely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was luckier than some of the other fellows,&rdquo;
Jerry said modestly. &ldquo;That was all. Now they&rsquo;ve
sent me home to rest up for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s marvelous!&rdquo; Penny said, guiding him toward
the waiting car. &ldquo;You can spend all of your
spare time with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry grinned down at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better.
But I&rsquo;m not exactly on furlough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you just said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing a special mission here at Sunset Beach
for the Army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you dare tell about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry helped the girls into the car, stowed the suitcases
away, and then slid in beside Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you very much,&rdquo; he replied quietly.
&ldquo;But I can give you a general idea of why I&rsquo;m here.
There&rsquo;s a certain outlaw radio station that has been
causing the government considerable annoyance. I&rsquo;ve
been sent here to try to trace its location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why Dad&rsquo;s here too!&rdquo; Penny cried.
&ldquo;So you two schemers intended to join forces all
along! A pity no one could let me know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want your father to tell you, because until
the last minute I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was coming,&rdquo; Jerry
explained. &ldquo;The radio station assignment is only part
of the reason why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the other?&rdquo; Penny asked as she started the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the lookout for an escaped German flier.
The fellow escaped from a Canadian prison camp and
was traced to this locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re supposed to be taking a rest from
flying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This assignment will be a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it anything but one,&rdquo; Penny said indignantly.
Her face suddenly became grave.
&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that escaped prisoner look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t describe him. I have a photograph in
my brief case. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Jerry could not hide a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why at our camp in the woods!&rdquo; Excitedly
Penny told of the bearded stranger who had robbed
the Parker stores of food and clothing. Her description
of the man was so vague that Jerry could make
little of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your thief isn&rsquo;t the man we&rsquo;re after,&rdquo;
he said kindly. &ldquo;After I get to a hotel and open my
luggage, I&rsquo;ll show you his picture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And will you let me help you trail him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Jerry answered, only half meaning it.
&ldquo;By the way, drive me to the Crystal Inn. I have a
reservation there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong with the place?&rdquo; Jerry inquired,
observing her change of expression.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;The place is all right. It&rsquo;s
the people who stay there. Jerry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you susceptible to brunettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll likely meet a Mrs. Deline at the hotel,&rdquo;
Penny warned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have a thing to do with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; Jerry was amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s already made a jelly fish of Dad,&rdquo; Penny
went on. &ldquo;Jerry, stop grinning! This is serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t know I was smiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need your help, Jerry. The truth is, I&rsquo;m terribly
worried about Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know your father, there&rsquo;s no need to worry
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t understand this Mrs. Deline,&rdquo;
Penny said desperately. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very clever, scheming
woman. Jerry, will you promise to help me try
to save Dad from her clutches?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Jerry managed to keep his face straight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
my best,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep sigh. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re
here,&rdquo; she murmured gratefully. &ldquo;With you fighting
on my side, the war&rsquo;s as good as won!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>HELP FROM MR. EMORY</i></h2>
<p>With Jerry at Sunset Beach, the vacation already
promised to take on a rosy hue. Penny was so
thrilled to be with her friends again that she paid scant
heed to her driving. Several times, enroute to the
Crystal Inn, Louise had to warn her to steer more
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry, now that you&rsquo;re here the fun will
start!&rdquo; Penny declared happily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how
dull things have been without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that goes double,&rdquo; Jerry said with emphasis.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine!&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;Camping has made
him cross though. By the way, did he know you
were coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I sent him a wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so! Dad&rsquo;s been keeping it from me.
Why all the secrecy, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my trip here isn&rsquo;t exactly a pleasure jaunt.
And if I have luck, I&rsquo;ll be gone again in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope you have no luck then,&rdquo; Penny
said with a laugh.</p>
<p>The car drew up at the Crystal Inn and Jerry
unloaded his suitcase. He was taller, Penny thought,
or at least more filled out. The trim uniform set off
his broad shoulders. As he bent to pick up his luggage,
a group of women on the hotel veranda turned
to stare at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check in and clean up a bit,&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;Then where can I meet you girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be somewhere on the beach,&rdquo; Penny replied
carelessly. &ldquo;Do hurry, Jerry. We have a million
things to talk over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls parked the car not far from the hotel. As
they walked along, scuffing their shoes in the loose
sand, they saw Mrs. Deline coming toward them from
the direction of Crag Point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s evidently been at the lighthouse all this
time!&rdquo; Penny commented in an undertone. &ldquo;Now
how did she get in there for a visit when I couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline saw that she would meet the girls.
Frowning, she glanced quickly toward the boardwalk
as if seeking an avenue of escape. However, she
could not avoid meeting them without appearing to
do so deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; she greeted Penny coldly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Penny paused to introduce Louise. Mrs. Deline
acknowledged the girl with an indifferent nod.
Somewhat confused, Louise nervously twisted a silver
ring she wore. It slipped from her finger and fell
into the loose sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how awkward of me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and
stooped to retrieve it.</p>
<p>The ring buried itself deeper in the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lose it entirely if you&rsquo;re not careful!&rdquo;
Penny warned. &ldquo;Here, let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting down on their knees, the girls sifted the
sand with their hands. Mrs. Deline seemed amused
by their difficulties and did not offer to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be getting on to the hotel,&rdquo; she said
casually. &ldquo;I took a long walk this afternoon and I&rsquo;m
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the lighthouse?&rdquo; Penny commented, before
she stopped to think.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline glanced at her sharply. &ldquo;No, not to
the lighthouse,&rdquo; she replied in a tone meant to put
the girl in her place. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think of walking
that far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought I saw you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw me?&rdquo; Mrs. Deline laughed. &ldquo;Well, my
dear, you certainly were mistaken. I walked to the
12th Street bridge. No farther.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Penny started to reply, then thought better of it.
There was no point in arguing with Mrs. Deline.
However, she was certain she had seen the widow
at the lighthouse. Why the woman should deny it
she could not imagine.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Deline had gone, Penny and Louise
searched in vain for the missing ring. They knew
it could not be many inches away, yet it kept eluding
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t afford to lose the ring!&rdquo; Louise wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How valuable is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth much from a money standpoint. I
drew it as a prize in a piece of wedding cake and I&rsquo;ve
always kept it as a good luck piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; Penny said confidently. &ldquo;That is,
if the tide doesn&rsquo;t catch us first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she spoke, a wave came rippling up the
beach. It broke only a few feet away, showering the
girls with spray and wetting their shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the tide flows over this spot, I never will find the
ring,&rdquo; Louise cried in vexation. &ldquo;Such wretched
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having trouble?&rdquo; inquired a deep masculine voice.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise raised their heads. Unnoticed
by them, a stranger had approached. The man wore
a wet bathing suit plastered with sand. He had on
glasses and a moment elapsed before Penny recognized
him as the same fisherman who had warned her
about the tide at Crag Point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m George Emory,&rdquo; he introduced himself.
&ldquo;Have you lost something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ring,&rdquo; Louise explained.</p>
<p>The man helped the girls search for the missing
trinket. By now waves were creeping higher and
higher on the beach. A particularly big one sent
Penny and Louise scurrying for safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use looking any longer for the ring,&rdquo;
Louise gave up. &ldquo;Perhaps I can find it after the tide
turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By then it will be washed away,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Emory. &ldquo;Ah! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped to pick a shiny object from the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ring!&rdquo; Louise cried in delight. &ldquo;Oh, thank
you for finding it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three retreated to higher ground. As Penny
and Louise were about to start for the hotel, Mr.
Emory suggested that they might like to share a picnic
lunch with him. Neither of the girls was hungry, but
to offend the man after he had found Louise&rsquo;s ring
was unthinkable. Accordingly, they accompanied
him to one of the gaily painted wooden umbrellas
along the beach. Beneath its shade Mr. Emory spread
a paper tablecloth and produced ample supplies of
sandwiches, fruit and lemonade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you expecting to eat all this food yourself?&rdquo;
Penny asked in amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was hoping to find a companion who would
share it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Emory. &ldquo;The truth is, I&rsquo;m a
pretty lonely old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise stole a quick look at the stranger.
By no stretch of the imagination could they call him
old. Judging from appearances, he was not yet forty
years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife died a few years ago,&rdquo; Mr. Emory explained
sadly. &ldquo;Since then I&rsquo;ve been like a ship without
a rudder. I have plenty of money, but I don&rsquo;t get
much enjoyment out of life. I go wherever it suits
my fancy, stay until I weary of it, then move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; Penny murmured with a show of sympathy.</p>
<p>She felt ashamed of herself that the story did not
move her more deeply. Mr. Emory evidently was a
lonely fellow, deserving of companionship. Yet for
some reason, he failed to interest her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been at Sunset Beach long?&rdquo; she inquired
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about a month. I know every nook and
cranny along the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Penny asked, and her interest revived.
&ldquo;Are there many caves near Sunset Beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of them, though none very close. There
are several near the lighthouse, back among the rocks.
Crystal Cave probably is the most interesting. Then
there are half a dozen scattered on up the shore.
Interested in caves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, in a general way,&rdquo; Penny replied carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny is interested in anything that suggests mystery,&rdquo;
Louise volunteered with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou&rsquo;s joking,&rdquo; Penny said quickly. She gave her
chum a hard look which was not lost upon Mr.
Emory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Penny!&rdquo; Louise refused to be silenced.
&ldquo;Only a few minutes ago you were telling me about
a radio broadcast said to come from a cave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just my idea,&rdquo; Penny said, confused.
She jumped hastily to her feet. &ldquo;We really should
be going, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurry away.&rdquo; Mr. Emory offered Louise
another sandwich. &ldquo;Speaking of mysterious radio
stations, I&rsquo;ve heard of one that is said to be located in a
cave somewhere along these shores. Fact is, I&rsquo;ve
searched for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo; Penny asked, sinking back into the
sand. &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. But I did manage to kill quite a few afternoons.
I take it that your father came to Sunset
Beach to help the authorities search for the station.
Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever made you think that?&rdquo; Penny
asked, instantly on guard. &ldquo;Do you know my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I regret I haven&rsquo;t the honor. I chanced to overhear
a conversation at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Penny murmured. She was certain that the
information could have leaked out in only one way.
Her father had told Mrs. Deline, who in turn had
spread the news about the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I&rsquo;m not inquiring into secrets,&rdquo; Mr. Emory
went on cheerfully. &ldquo;Fact of the matter is, I might
be able to help your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Dad will want to talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look forward to meeting your father. Think
you can arrange it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose so,&rdquo; Penny said, though with no
great enthusiasm. Again she experienced a queer,
uneasy feeling. She did not entirely trust Mr. Emory.</p>
<p>The man smiled and seemed to relax. As the girls
arose to leave he tried once more to detain them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that old fellow down the beach?&rdquo; he inquired,
pointing to an aged man who was picking up objects
from the sand with a sharp-pointed stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what about him?&rdquo; Penny asked, turning to
stare. &ldquo;Just an ordinary beachcomber, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not call Old Jake Skagway ordinary,&rdquo; Mr.
Emory corrected. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really interested in
solving the radio station mystery, I&rsquo;d advise you to
keep watch of that rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why him?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; Mr. Emory said with finality.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a tip. Take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yawning, he stretched himself full length on the
sand and turned his back to the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>A MAN OF MYSTERY</i></h2>
<p>The following day when Penny told her
father of Mr. Emory&rsquo;s desire to meet him, Mr. Parker
showed little interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time to waste getting acquainted with
strangers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why is the man so eager to
know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks he may be able to help you locate that
hidden radio station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker&rsquo;s annoyance visibly increased. &ldquo;Penny,&rdquo;
he said severely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve evidently been talking out
of turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to let him know why you&rsquo;re at Sunset
Beach, Dad. It sort of slipped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise, who was washing the breakfast dishes, spoke
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Penny tried to
stop me, but I gave the information before I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Mr. Parker assured her
kindly. &ldquo;I came here mostly for a vacation. If I
should be lucky enough to dig up a few facts about
the radio station, well and good. If not, no harm will
have been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent for Jerry to help you?&rdquo; Penny inquired
curiously.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker shook his head. &ldquo;No, I knew he was
coming, but I didn&rsquo;t send for him. If I had, I&rsquo;m afraid
the Army wouldn&rsquo;t have been obliging enough to
have filled my order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny helped Louise put away the camp dishes and
pick up loose papers. It was only eight-thirty but
already most of the work had been done. With
Louise to help, camping no longer was a burden.
Even Mr. Parker seemed to have moments of enjoying
the outdoor life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone riding to Sunset Beach with me?&rdquo; he
inquired cheerfully. &ldquo;I have a date with Jerry this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise both wanted to go. They washed
at the brook, changed into becoming &ldquo;town&rdquo; dresses,
and soon were ready.</p>
<p>At the Crystal Inn, Jerry was not to be found. A
clerk explained that the young man had left the hotel
a half hour earlier but was expected to return soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably went somewhere for breakfast or a
walk,&rdquo; Mr. Parker remarked, sinking into a comfortable
chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Penny and Louise loitered in the lobby. Presently
Mrs. Deline came from the dining room and Mr.
Parker politely arose to greet her. The widow took
a chair beside him and they began to chat in an animated
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get away from here!&rdquo; Penny muttered to
Louise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls went outside into the warm sunshine.
Because the Parker automobile was at the curb they
climbed into it and sat watching the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you dislike Mrs. Deline so intensely?&rdquo;
Louise presently asked her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s aiming to be my stepmother, that&rsquo;s
why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny!&rdquo; Louise laughed outright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
you have a mistaken idea about the entire situation.
Your father isn&rsquo;t serious in liking her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s certainly developed remarkable talents
for acting,&rdquo; Penny retorted with a sniff. &ldquo;I wish
we&rsquo;d never come to Sunset Beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be willing to forego the mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares about a radio station?&rdquo; Penny asked
crossly. &ldquo;Dad won&rsquo;t tell me anything about the case,
and probably Jerry won&rsquo;t either. It seems to be one
of those affairs for the experts only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know you, Penny, you&rsquo;ll manage to get in on
the affair,&rdquo; Louise said, her eyes twinkling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Penny turned on the ignition and started the car.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not interested,&rdquo; she announced flatly. &ldquo;Mrs.
Deline has taken all the fun out of me. Want to go
for a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just up the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous to drive on the sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone does it at low tide. The sand is hard
and firm along this stretch of beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise offered no further objection, so Penny
drove slowly away from the hotel. The car rode on
silken tires, making only a soft swishing sound as it
rolled smoothly over the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is fun!&rdquo; Louise cried in delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might drive to the lighthouse,&rdquo; Penny proposed,
steering to avoid two bathers who crossed in
front of the car.</p>
<p>Following the curve of the beach, the girls kept
on until the sand became so soft that they were afraid
to drive farther. The lighthouse was close by. Penny,
curious to learn what sort of reception the keeper
would accord her on the second visit, proposed to
Louise that they call there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he let Mrs. Deline visit the tower why can&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;Come along, let&rsquo;s try to get in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abandoning the car on the beach, they waded
through the dunes, climbed a fence, and ultimately
reached the base of the tower. No one seemed to be
in evidence. Penny started boldly up the iron steps.
However, before she had gone very far, the keeper,
Jim McCoy, came out on the platform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you no visitors are allowed here?&rdquo; he
called down angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a lady come here yesterday!&rdquo; Penny returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have dreamed it,&rdquo; retorted the lighthouse
keeper. &ldquo;No visitors allowed. Don&rsquo;t make
me tell you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny retreated, decidedly crushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked for it, kitten,&rdquo; Louise teased as they
walked toward the car. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame the keeper
for not wanting visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline was there,&rdquo; Penny insisted stubbornly.
&ldquo;Why should he deny it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half way to the car, the girls paused to pick up a
few large shells lying in the deep sand. The task became
an absorbing one. Before they realized it, the
sun was high overhead and their faces were being
burned by the direct rays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Louise urged. &ldquo;The tide turned a long
while ago. We should be returning to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Penny agreed. She stooped to pick up
another shell. As she straightened, she observed an
old man in ragged clothing coming down the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou,&rdquo; she said in a low tone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that same
man Mr. Emory was telling us about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beachcomber?&rdquo; Louise turned to stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s coming this way. Perhaps it might
be worth while to watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not seen us yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced about for a hiding place. The only
one that offered was a huge sand dune. Pulling Louise
along with her, she crouched down out of sight.</p>
<p>In a moment the old beachcomber came along. He
was whistling and seemed to have not a care in the
world. His face, viewed at close range, was weather-beaten,
his hair uncombed, and his clothing had not
been washed in many a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so mysterious about him?&rdquo; Louise whispered.
&ldquo;Why did Mr. Emory say he&rsquo;d bear watching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s not really a beachcomber,&rdquo; Penny returned,
low. &ldquo;He may be an Enemy Agent in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have Enemy Agents on the brain!&rdquo; Louise
chuckled. &ldquo;Likewise, man-snatching widows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beachcomber passed within a few feet of the
girls. He crossed the courtyard of the lighthouse
and was seen to take a trail which led amid the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, perhaps he&rsquo;s going to one of the caves!&rdquo;
Penny cried. &ldquo;You know Mr. Emory said this locality
is honeycombed with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; Louise answered indifferently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
lunch time and I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your appetite will have to wait. I&rsquo;m going to
follow that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this may be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it may be just another of your so-called
bright ideas,&rdquo; Louise retorted. &ldquo;Well, lead on, and
let&rsquo;s get it over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beachcomber already had disappeared amid
the mass of piled-up rock farther back from shore.
Penny had marked the locality well with her eye.
She was able to lead Louise to the place where he
had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s a well-worn trail,&rdquo; she indicated triumphantly.
&ldquo;He must have taken it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed the path, and a moment later caught
a fleeting glimpse of the beachcomber. At times the
trail was so narrow that the girls barely could squeeze
between the rocks. Wind whistled around the cliffs,
whipping hair and blowing skirts.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Penny, who was in the lead, came
to the low entranceway of a cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gone in there!&rdquo; she declared excitedly.
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From deep within the cave the girls could hear a
strange sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rushing water!&rdquo; Louise said in awe. &ldquo;The Cave
must have a waterfall or an underground river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know.&rdquo; Penny started into the cave
only to have Louise clutch at her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Penny. We have no flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t let that beachcomber get away. We
want to learn what he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can bear up without knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny announced with equal firmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may be dangerous. Let&rsquo;s go back to the
hotel and get Jerry or your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, then shook her head. &ldquo;You stay
here if you like, Lou,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before her chum could detain her, she stooped low
and crawled into the narrow, dark tunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>CAUGHT BY THE TIDE</i></h2>
<p>Unwilling to be left behind, Louise followed
her chum into the dark cavern. Once she and Penny
were well beyond the yawning mouth of the cave,
they could not see a foot ahead of them. Guided by
the sound of rushing water, they groped their way
along a damp wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; Louise whispered nervously.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny might have yielded to her chum&rsquo;s coaxing
but at that moment the tunnel broadened out and became
lighter. Directly ahead a series of steps led
down to a lower room of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place must be safe enough or steps wouldn&rsquo;t
have been built here,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
nervous, Lou. We may discover something important.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Louise muttered that they were more likely to
break their necks. However, she cautiously followed
Penny down the rock-hewn steps. Half way
down, they both paused. From below came a weird
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Louise whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded for all the world like the note of a
pipe organ!&rdquo; Penny observed. &ldquo;There it is again&mdash;a
different tone this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noiselessly the girls moved on down the steps.
Ahead of them they now could see a moving light
which undoubtedly was a flash lantern carried by the
beachcomber. Drawing closer, they saw the man
himself. In the great cavern his shadow appeared
grotesque and huge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; Louise whispered in awe.</p>
<p>The man was unaware that he had been followed.
He stood in the center of the great chamber, gazing
with wrapt expression at the stalagmites which rose
in strange formations from the cave floor. The girls
could hear him muttering to himself. At the risk of
being seen they moved closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music! Music!&rdquo; the old man mumbled. &ldquo;Talk
about your pipe organs! They ain&rsquo;t in it with <i>this</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held a long stick in his hand and with it began
to explore the row of stalagmites, striking them one
by one, at first with a slow tempo and then faster and
faster. The weird sounds echoed and reached
through the galleries of the cavern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo; the old man prattled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the music o&rsquo;
Heaven. There ain&rsquo;t no music to equal it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the beachcomber struck the stalagmites, listening
raptly while the sounds died slowly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Penny,&rdquo; Louise urged, tugging at her
hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here. That old goof has
lost his buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly crestfallen, Penny permitted herself to
be pulled along the passage and up the steps. As the
girls groped their way to the cave&rsquo;s mouth, they still
could hear the weird echoing tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a good joke on you!&rdquo; Louise teased.
&ldquo;You thought you were going to find a hidden radio
station!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we did find a cave,&rdquo; Penny said defensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t exactly discover it,&rdquo; Louise amended.
&ldquo;This must be Crystal Cave. Seemingly that old
beachcomber regards it as his own personal property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Emory certainly gave us a wrong steer. A
mysterious character, my eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll admit that the old fellow is interesting,&rdquo;
Louise laughed. &ldquo;However, I doubt he&rsquo;ll warrant
much attention from the FBI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, laugh,&rdquo; Penny retorted grimly. &ldquo;You
think my detective efforts are a joke anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Penny. But I will say I doubt you&rsquo;ll
have success tracing a hidden radio station. After
all, it&rsquo;s a problem that has the State authorities baffled.
Not to mention Uncle Sam&rsquo;s Army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stepped from the cave out into the brilliant
sunshine. Gazing toward the sea, they were
amazed to see how high the tide had risen. Giant
waves were washing very close to the Parker automobile
left on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye fishes!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed in horror. &ldquo;I forgot
all about the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the tide&rsquo;s coming in fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Point will be cut off in a few more minutes!&rdquo;
Penny added, recalling Mr. Emory&rsquo;s warning. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to travel, and travel fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling down from the rocks, the girls plunged
through the dunes to the beach. A wind was blowing
and the sea had an angry look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If just one wave strikes the car, the wheels will
sink in the sand, and then we&rsquo;ll be in it!&rdquo; Penny cried.</p>
<p>With increasing alarm she noted that sand was
damp within a foot of the rear wheels. And as she
jerked open the car door, a greedy wave nipped again
at the rubber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be out of here,&rdquo; Louise said encouragingly.</p>
<p>Penny stepped on the starter and to her relief the
motor caught instantly. In great haste she turned
the car around, circling away from the inrushing sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; Louise warned. &ldquo;The sand is dreadfully
soft this far up shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too late Penny realized the same thing. She could
feel the car starting to bog down. The motor began
to labor. Then the car stalled completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>Both girls sprang out to look at the wheels. Their
spirits sank. On one side, front and rear tires were
bogged deep in sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start the engine again!&rdquo; Louise urged desperately.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny obeyed, but her chum&rsquo;s puny strength made
not the slightest impression upon the car. It could
not be moved a foot. The spinning wheels only
drove deeper and deeper into the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Louise asked helplessly. She
turned to stare at the incoming sea. Each wave was
breaking a little closer to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place will be under in another twenty minutes,&rdquo;
Penny calculated. &ldquo;Even if the car isn&rsquo;t washed
away, the salt water will ruin it. How did we ever
get into such a mess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just by being careless. If only we weren&rsquo;t so far
from the hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run to the lighthouse,&rdquo; Penny decided desperately.
&ldquo;Maybe the keeper will help us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Both girls were badly frightened, not for their own
safety, but because they feared that the car would be
damaged beyond repair. Once the waves began to
strike it, it would sink deeper and deeper into the
sand. Salt water would corrode all of the bright
chromium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no time to waste!&rdquo; Penny cried, darting
away.</p>
<p>The girls plunged through the sand drifts to the
lighthouse. Evidently the keeper already had observed
their plight, for he was standing on the upper
platform peering down into the courtyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our car is stuck in the sand!&rdquo; Penny shouted.
&ldquo;Can you help us get it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the keeper answered gruffly. &ldquo;You
should have watched the tide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else to help us,&rdquo; Penny pleaded.
&ldquo;Just a little push&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m forbidden to leave my post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you telephone to the Inn? Or to a
garage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could &rsquo;phone but it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; the
keeper said reluctantly. &ldquo;Your car will be under
water before a tow-car could get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exasperated by the man&rsquo;s unwillingness to help,
Louise and Penny ran back to the car. Already waves
were lapping against the rear wheels. The situation
seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I try to push again?&rdquo; Louise asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good. We&rsquo;re not strong
enough.&rdquo; In desperation, Penny&rsquo;s gaze wandered
down the deserted shore. Suddenly she saw a lone
fisherman who was wading through the surf. She
recognized him as George Emory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll help us!&rdquo; she cried confidently.</p>
<p>The girls shouted Mr. Emory&rsquo;s name. Apparently
he heard, for he turned his head quickly. Their
plight, they thought, must be instantly evident, but
Mr. Emory did not seem to comprehend. He waved
his hand as if in friendly greeting, and then, reeling
in his fish line, turned and walked away from them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>A HIDDEN PACKAGE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Emory doesn&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; Penny
cried, aghast. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he see that we&rsquo;re stuck here
with the tide rolling in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls shouted again and again. If the man
heard, he gave no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he wanted to help us!&rdquo; Penny declared
furiously. &ldquo;Probably he&rsquo;s afraid he&rsquo;ll over-strain
himself pushing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwilling to give up without a last try, she sprang
into the car and once more started the engine. It
roared and labored but could not pull the vehicle.
Sick with despair, Penny allowed the motor to idle.
She slumped behind the steering wheel, only to
straighten suddenly as she thought she heard her
name called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Louise too heard the cry for she turned quickly
toward the main road some yards back from the
beach. A young man in uniform was running across
the dunes toward the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jerry!&rdquo; Penny cried jubilantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll help
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will if he can,&rdquo; Louise corrected. &ldquo;The tide&rsquo;s
coming in so fast now. I doubt anyone can get us
out of here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry did not waste time asking questions. Taking
in the situation at a glance, he instructed Penny to
remain at the wheel. With the motor racing, he and
Louise pushed with all their strength. At first the
rear wheels kept spinning in the sand. A great wave
slapped the rear end of the car, spraying Louise from
head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can!&rdquo; Jerry insisted. &ldquo;Try once more,
Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they pushed and this time the car actually
moved a few feet before it bogged down. Encouraged,
Jerry and Louise tried harder than before. The
wheels suddenly struck firm sand, dug in, and the
car began to creep forward. Penny kept it moving
until she was sure the footing beneath the tires was
solid. Then she pulled up so that Jerry and Louise
might leap aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive as fast as you can for the hotel!&rdquo; Jerry instructed
crisply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be lucky to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Where an hour before the roadway along the
beach had been wide and ample, there now was only
a fringe of white sand. To avoid the incoming waves,
Penny had to drive dangerously close to the dunes.
And midway to the hotel, they came to a flooded
stretch of beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to risk it,&rdquo; Jerry advised as Penny
hesitated to drive on.</p>
<p>The water was not deep but the sand was wet and
treacherous. Choosing a moment between breakers,
Penny braved it, and to her intense relief the car
rolled through without sinking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear sailing now,&rdquo; Jerry said as a wider strip
of beach opened before them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re well beyond
the Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Emory was walking along the shore and as the
car went past, he waved his hand in a friendly way.
Penny did not bother to return the salute, pretending
she did not see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he knew we were in trouble and didn&rsquo;t
want to help,&rdquo; she told Jerry. &ldquo;The more I see of
that man the less I like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a vacationer. He got Lou and me all excited
yesterday with his talk about that hidden radio station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Jerry asked with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Penny repeated the conversation, and mentioned
how Mr. Emory had suggested that the old beachcomber
was a mysterious character that would bear
watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not old Jake Skagway?&rdquo; Jerry asked, amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that was his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake&rsquo;s the only beachcomber I know hereabouts.
He makes his living picking up things on the beach
and selling them. Folks say he buries some of his
loot in the caves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know so much about him, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I used to run down to Sunset Beach real often
years ago. I know this locality like a book. Guess
that&rsquo;s why the Army sent me here to do a little scouting
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited expectantly, but Jerry offered no
more information as to the reason for his visit to Sunset
Beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Lou and I were taken in by Jake Skagway,&rdquo;
she admitted after a moment. &ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t
followed him into the cave, we certainly wouldn&rsquo;t
have involved ourselves in such difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Crystal Inn a few minutes
later, the girls searched for Mr. Parker. He was nowhere
to be found. After waiting for a time, they
left the car with Jerry and hiked to the forest camp.
There the early afternoon was devoted to camp tasks.
When Mr. Parker still did not come, Penny proposed
that they return to Sunset Beach for a plunge in the
surf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too cold,&rdquo; Louise shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go down to Sunset Beach anyhow,&rdquo;
Penny urged. &ldquo;I get restless just sitting here in
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you want to see Jerry again,&rdquo; Louise
teased. &ldquo;&rsquo;Fess up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I do want to see him,&rdquo; Penny admitted
unabashed. &ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s my very best friend. I&rsquo;ve not
been with him in months and I suppose in a few days
he&rsquo;ll be shot off to goodness-knows-where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not told you very much about why he came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Penny said briefly. The subject was a sore
one with her. She felt that both her father and Jerry
were keeping secrets.</p>
<p>The tide was still high when the girls reached the
beach, but the flow was outward. Sprawling in the
warm sand, they watched the gulls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what became of Jerry and Dad?&rdquo; Penny
speculated. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably together somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or with Mrs. Deline,&rdquo; Louise suggested wickedly.</p>
<p>She was sorry that she had spoken for Penny&rsquo;s face
immediately became as black as a thundercloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Louise apologized. &ldquo;I was only joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny continued to scowl for at that moment she
glimpsed Mrs. Deline walking rapidly down the
beach. The widow came from the direction of the
lighthouse and was alone. To avoid the incoming
waves she waded ankle deep through the great sand
ridges along the drift fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Penny muttered, sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Deline apparently has been at the
lighthouse again. What&rsquo;s she doing now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow had paused. Carefully she gazed up
and down the deserted shore, but she did not see
Penny and Louise who were hidden from view by
a sand dune. However, by raising up slightly, they
could see her plainly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline carried a package of considerable size
under her arm. Seemingly satisfied that no one was
at hand to observe her actions, she moved swiftly to
one of the sand dunes near the drift fence. As the
girls watched in amazement, she dug a deep hole and
buried the package. Her work completed, she carefully
brushed sand over the spot and obliterated her
own footprints one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the idea of that?&rdquo; Louise asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know!&rdquo; Penny muttered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait until she leaves and then find out the contents
of that package!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Deline did not immediately go away. Instead
she sat down in the sand close by. The girls
could not see very well but they thought she was
writing something on the skirt of her white suit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why is she doing that?&rdquo; Louise asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie she&rsquo;s writing down the location
of what she hid in the sand dune!&rdquo; Penny speculated.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so she can find it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why write it on her skirt? And why should
she hide anything here on the beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s a spy!&rdquo; Penny declared triumphantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been suspicious of her from the first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, darling,&rdquo; agreed Louise. &ldquo;But
would a spy necessarily hide a package? If Mrs.
Deline had information to communicate wouldn&rsquo;t she
send it to her superiors? Besides, Sunset Beach isn&rsquo;t
even an important manufacturing town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But I&rsquo;ve heard Dad say that the
Coast Guards watch this place closely. Because of its
isolation and jagged coastline it&rsquo;s considered a likely
spot for surprise night landings by the Enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this morning you thought old Jake Skagway
was a rascal,&rdquo; Louise chuckled. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t catch
me falling for your theories this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have no interest in that hidden package?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have! I merely don&rsquo;t agree that Mrs.
Deline is a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; Penny warned. &ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Mrs. Deline had arisen from the sand and came rapidly
down the beach. She did not see the girls until
she was very close to them. Involuntarily, she
paused, and looked somewhat disconcerted. Recovering,
she spoke coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Penny responded, her gaze on the
woman&rsquo;s white flannel skirt. It bore not a single tell-tale
mark.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline went on down the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Louise whispered when the woman was
beyond hearing, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t write anything on her
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we saw her do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only thought we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she wrote it in invisible ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, you certainly have an imagination,&rdquo;
Louise sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I imagined about the package too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she really did bury something in the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we waiting for?&rdquo; Penny demanded,
leaping to her feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dig it up, and
then maybe we&rsquo;ll have the answer to a few of our
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>VOICE FROM THE CAVE</i></h2>
<p>From a distance Penny and Louise had marked well
the spot where Mrs. Deline had buried the package.
But as they approached the drift fence all of the dunes
seemed strikingly similar in appearance. They could
not agree as to the exact mound which contained the
hidden package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was buried in this one, I think,&rdquo; Penny said,
starting to dig. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline certainly did a good job
of covering her tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting time working on that dune,&rdquo;
Louise insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get busy over here and turn up
the package in nothing flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selecting a mound of sand several feet from Penny,
she began to dig with a will. The mysterious package
proved elusive. Scarcely had the girls started work
than a few raindrops splattered down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s going to storm!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed, turning
startled eyes toward the dark sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>The rain came down faster and faster. Faced with
a choice of abandoning the search or being drenched,
the girls decided to make a dash for the hotel.</p>
<p>As they darted up the steps at the Crystal Inn,
they were surprised to see Mrs. Deline sitting on the
veranda. A spyglass lay in her lap. Whether she
had been watching the sea or their own antics they
had no way of knowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen my father, Mrs. Deline?&rdquo; Penny
asked, shaking the raindrops from her flying hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t keep track of his whereabouts,&rdquo;
Mrs. Deline replied coldly. &ldquo;By the way, did you
find what you were searching for in the sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question caught Penny off guard. She stammered
a few words which only caused the widow to
smile in a knowing, amused way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you what I buried in the
sand,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;It may save you a little trouble.
The package contained nothing but fish bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish bones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had just visited my friend, Jim McCoy, at
the lighthouse. It&rsquo;s most difficult to bury anything
there because of so many rocks. He asked me to dispose
of the scraps for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Penny murmured, completely deflated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching you girls through the spyglass,&rdquo;
Mrs. Deline went on. &ldquo;It really was amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine,&rdquo; Penny agreed grimly. &ldquo;Oh, well,
I&rsquo;m glad to provide a little amusement for this dead
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and Louise retreated until they were screened
from the widow by a potted palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she scored on you that time, Penny,&rdquo; Louise
commented. &ldquo;So we wasted our strength digging
for garbage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t rub it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all so silly. Why don&rsquo;t we try to like Mrs.
Deline, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that job up to you. Furthermore, how
do I know she was telling the truth? Maybe she just
handed us that story so we wouldn&rsquo;t go on digging in
the dunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; Louise acknowledged. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline
isn&rsquo;t the type to be doing gracious little jobs for
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Jim McCoy asked her to bury a package of
garbage, she would have disposed of it long before she
did,&rdquo; Penny reasoned. &ldquo;Instead, she walked quite a
distance down shore. Then she seemed to select a
particular dune, as if by pre-arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she may have hidden something there
expecting another person to pick it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my theory, Lou. Oh, I wish this rain
would let up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Restlessly Penny walked to a window. The rain
showed signs of slackening. And as she watched, a
taxi drew up in front of the hotel. Jerry Livingston
leaped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me!&rdquo; he instructed the driver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise managed to block Jerry&rsquo;s path
as he came hurrying into the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, girls,&rdquo; he greeted them offhanded. &ldquo;Want
to go for a drive into the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do,&rdquo; Penny accepted for both.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our destination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you on the way,&rdquo; Jerry answered.</p>
<p>He disappeared into an elevator, but was back in
the lobby within a few minutes. Taking Penny and
Louise each by an elbow, he escorted them to the
waiting cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, this is a secret trip,&rdquo; he said after he had
given directions to the driver. &ldquo;Ever see a radio monitoring
truck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never even heard of one,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have a truck equipped so that our instruments
pick up the direction from which any short
wave broadcast is sent. It&rsquo;s not generally known
that the Army&rsquo;s at work here, so whatever you girls
see you must keep under your sunbonnets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>The taxi sped along the country road, following
a route that was unfamiliar to the girls. By the time
it drew up several miles from Sunset Beach the rain
had ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumble out,&rdquo; Jerry said, opening the cab door.
&ldquo;This is the end of the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went ahead, breaking a hole in the tall hedge
at one side of the road. Eagerly the girls followed
him through the gap. In a clearing just beyond a
clump of saplings stood what appeared to be an ordinary
covered Army truck.</p>
<p>An enlisted man came toward Jerry and the girls,
saluting smartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you picking up any signals?&rdquo; Jerry asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing yet, sir. The weather hasn&rsquo;t been very
favorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your equipment set up here two days
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not likely we&rsquo;ll get anything today or tonight,&rdquo;
Jerry replied. &ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll have to have
patience. Sooner or later the station will go on the
air again, and then we&rsquo;ll learn its location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise and Penny were curious to learn more about
the monitoring truck. Jerry took them inside, introduced
them to the officers, and showed them the radio
apparatus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our truck is equipped with rotating antennae,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;Whenever the unknown station starts
to broadcast we&rsquo;ll be able to swing our loops toward
the signals. Then we chart the signals and where the
lines intercept, the station is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you explain it, Jerry, finding any radio station
is a simple matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, providing the station doesn&rsquo;t move in the
meantime. Unfortunately, Mr. Voice from the Cave
is an elusive fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea who the man may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s known to FBI agents only as B4 which is
a code number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the purpose behind the broadcasts?&rdquo;
Louise inquired. &ldquo;Enemy propaganda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that the station is enemy owned and
operated,&rdquo; Jerry replied. &ldquo;So far that&rsquo;s about all we
do know, for we&rsquo;ve been unable to break the code.
We suspect that persons connected with the station
may be aiding German prisoners to escape from the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners originally held in Canada?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve been aided by a ring of very clever
spies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was silent as she thought over the information.
There were many questions she longed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but just then there came an
interruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>In the Army truck an officer had adjusted his earphones.
His attitude as he listened was one of tense
expectancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picking up any signals?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.</p>
<p>The other man nodded. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s coming in!
Yes, it&rsquo;s our friend, the Voice. In just a minute we
should know exactly where the station is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and the girls remained in the truck, eagerly
awaiting a report from the efficient men who manned
the radio direction finders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ve got it charted!&rdquo; came the terse announcement
a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the station located?&rdquo; Jerry demanded
eagerly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see the chart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thrust into his hand. Jerry stared at the intercepting
lines and then at a map of the district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the station seems to be located along the
shore!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Apparently in one of the
caves&mdash;Crystal Cave I&rsquo;d judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cave where Louise and I were!&rdquo;
Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;But we saw no shortwave radio
apparatus. Only crazy old Skagway who was playing
a tune on the stalagmites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, direction finders don&rsquo;t lie. The
broadcast came from Crystal Cave! But that doesn&rsquo;t
mean the station will be there fifteen minutes from
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the
Voice be caught before he has a chance to move his
portable outfit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message already has been sent to Headquarters.
Army men should be on their way to the cave now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, we&rsquo;re not far from Crystal Cave ourselves!&rdquo;
Penny exclaimed, her eyes dancing with
excitement. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go there too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can and will!&rdquo; Jerry laughed. &ldquo;But if we
expect to catch our friend, the Voice, there&rsquo;s no time
to lose. Come along, girls, if you&rsquo;re traveling with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>AFTERGLOW</i></h2>
<p>Penny sprawled on the grass beside the dying
embers of the camp fire. Listlessly, and with very
bad aim, she hurled acorns at a brown squirrel chattering
overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in a bad mood ever since we got back
from Crystal Cave,&rdquo; Louise observed, coming out of
the tent. &ldquo;But why take it out on that poor creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny raised herself on an elbow. She scowled and
did not reply.</p>
<p>Louise moved over to the fire, seating herself on a
log beside her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brace up,&rdquo; she said, slipping an arm about
Penny&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;In all my life I&rsquo;ve never seen you
act so discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel lower than the worms. Nothing&rsquo;s gone
right since we came to Sunset Beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I can&rsquo;t see that anything has gone
so very wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t our trip to the Crystal Cave a bust?&rdquo;
Penny demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise smiled wryly at the recollection. With
Jerry and the Army men, she and Penny had spent
the afternoon searching various caves along the
water front. Not a trace had been found of the mysterious
radio station which so plagued local authorities.
The search had been a long and exhausting one.
In the end, though the others kept on, she and Penny
had been compelled to give up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet hurt yet from scrambling over the rocks,&rdquo;
Penny declared. &ldquo;I suppose Jerry and those Army
officers will keep searching half the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll warrant they never do find the station,&rdquo;
Louise contributed. &ldquo;This is one mystery I wish you
had never stumbled into, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to feel the same way, Lou. This is
supposed to be a vacation. I&rsquo;d like to see Dad and
Jerry once in awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s bothering you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know Jerry will be here only a few
days at most,&rdquo; Penny said defensively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve barely
had a chance to say &lsquo;hello&rsquo; to him. Dad&rsquo;s always
down at the hotel too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you crave seems to be male companionship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Penny tossed a stick of wood on the fire, making
the sparks fly. &ldquo;I could do with a little,&rdquo; she admitted.
&ldquo;Life is too dull here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull?&rdquo; Louise gazed at her chum suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use being surrounded by mystery if one
can&rsquo;t get into the thick of it. So far all the adventure
has by-passed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might stir up a little excitement by looking
for that package Mrs. Deline buried in the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today,&rdquo; Penny said with a sigh. &ldquo;Too tired.
Besides, I told Jerry about it and he wasn&rsquo;t much impressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the reason for your gloom,&rdquo; Louise remarked
wisely. &ldquo;As a detective you don&rsquo;t rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that. Jerry met Mrs. Deline at the
hotel today and he thought her a very charming
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Louise laughed. &ldquo;No wonder you&rsquo;re all
smashed to bits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny got up from the grass and began preparations
for supper. She peeled a pan of potatoes and
opened a can of corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a bucket of water from the spring,&rdquo; she
said suggestively. &ldquo;Want to help me carry it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Louise agreed without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The trail led up a steep path to a rocky ledge from
which cool spring water gushed out of a steel pipe.
Penny drank deeply and then hung her tin bucket
over the outlet to fill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting to get dark,&rdquo; she observed, noticing
how shadowy the woods had grown. &ldquo;I hope Dad
returns to camp soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming now,&rdquo; Louise remarked as her
keen ears detected the sound of footsteps on the trail
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably one of the rangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny unhooked the water bucket from the pipe,
and the girls started down the trail, carrying it between
them. Emerging from among the trees, they
glimpsed a figure below them. A woman in a dark
cloak who carried a picnic hamper, was walking rapidly
up the winding trail.</p>
<p>Penny stopped so suddenly that she spilled water
on her sandals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, that&rsquo;s Mrs. Deline!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it, pet? She&rsquo;s evidently going on a
picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time of day? And alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that part of it does seem a bit odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pulled her chum into the bushes beside the
path. Crouching low beside their water bucket,
they allowed the woman to pass. Looking neither
to the right nor left, she hastened on up the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to be in a big hurry,&rdquo; Penny commented,
coming out of hiding. &ldquo;Now where do you
suppose she&rsquo;s going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably to the cabin. One of your ranger
friends told me about a rustic place farther up the
trail. It was built especially for the enjoyment of the
public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would Mrs. Deline go there alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she intends to meet someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, that&rsquo;s probably what she is going to do!&rdquo;
Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow her and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares for food?&rdquo; Penny demanded. &ldquo;If Dad
comes home he can rustle a little for himself. It&rsquo;s
more important that we follow Mrs. Deline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Louise agreed, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m in no mood to
walk very far. Remember, we&rsquo;ve had one wild chase
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the water bucket behind the bushes, the
girls set out in pursuit of Mrs. Deline. Not without
admiration they acknowledged that the widow was
a better trail climber than they. Though the hamper
she carried evidently was heavy, she fairly skimmed
up the rough trail. Penny and Louise fell farther
and farther behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s heading for the cabin all right,&rdquo; Penny
puffed. &ldquo;Of course she intends to meet someone.
Otherwise, she&rsquo;d have had her picnic on the beach or
some place closer to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>A clearing opened up through a gap in the trees.
Mrs. Deline paused as she came within view of the
rustic log cabin and gazed carefully about. The girls
saw her look at her wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has an appointment with someone,&rdquo; Penny
declared.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline walked to the door of the cabin and
tested it to make certain that it was unlocked. She
did not go inside. Instead, she set down the hamper
and gazed slowly about the clearing. Louise and
Penny, at the fringe of woods, saw her start as she
looked directly toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s seen us!&rdquo; Louise gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go out and meet her,&rdquo; Penny decided
instantly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend we just happened
to be coming this way. But we&rsquo;ll stick around and
see who she&rsquo;s meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline stiffened visibly as the girls sauntered
out of the woods toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a surprise meeting you,&rdquo; she said in
a tone none too friendly. &ldquo;Is your camp located near
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the trail a short distance,&rdquo; Penny replied,
thoroughly enjoying the widow&rsquo;s discomfiture.
&ldquo;Having a picnic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I love the outdoors and thought I&rsquo;d
take a hike this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather late for a picnic,&rdquo; Penny said pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took me longer to get here than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>In an effort to discourage her young annoyers,
Mrs. Deline pushed open the door of the cabin. Before
she could pick up the hamper, Penny seized it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;My how heavy!
All this food for one person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mrs. Deline answered. &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny set the hamper on the table. Deliberately
she raised the lid. The basket was filled with food,
enough for a dozen persons, and in the bottom she
saw a folded wool blanket. Beneath the blanket were
several bulky garments which she took to be men&rsquo;s
clothing. Before she could see plainly, Mrs. Deline
jerked the lid of the hamper into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; she said with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only trying to be helpful,&rdquo; Penny said, pretending
to look injured. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want Lou and
me to dust off the table and spread out the picnic
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me for saying so, I came
on this picnic to be alone. I enjoy solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s getting dark,&rdquo; Penny argued. &ldquo;We
wouldn&rsquo;t think of deserting you. The cabin has no
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the dark. Anyway, I brought candles.
I really prefer to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Thus dismissed, Louise started to leave. Penny
lingered, trying to think of some excuse. Just then,
from somewhere in the woods, she heard a shrill
whistle unlike any bird call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she asked alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Deline.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a moment later the woman sauntered
to an open cabin window. Deliberately she turned
her back to the girls, trying to block their view.
Quickly she raised and lowered her handkerchief.</p>
<p>The movement was deftly executed, but swift
though it was, Penny saw and understood. Mrs.
Deline had signaled to an unseen person beyond the
fringe of trees!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>SUSPICION</i></h2>
<p>Penny moved swiftly to the open cabin door,
gazing toward the darkening woods. No one was
visible amid the shadows. Yet she was certain that
Mrs. Deline had signaled to someone lurking among
the trees.</p>
<p>The widow had turned from the window to unfasten
the lid of the picnic hamper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you girls are here you may as well stay and
share my supper,&rdquo; she said without warmth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
enough food for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s chin tilted proudly. The invitation was
grudgingly given, and she meant to decline. Penny
forestalled her by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice of you, Mrs. Deline! Of course we&rsquo;ll
be delighted to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline made no reply, though obviously she
had not expected an acceptance. Irritably she laid
out the picnic dishes&mdash;sandwiches, a salad, cake,
cookies, and fruit&mdash;all carefully prepared and cooked
at the hotel kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did bring plenty of food for one
person,&rdquo; Penny commented, helping herself to a
chicken sandwich. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that clothing in the bottom
of the basket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a blanket.&rdquo; Mrs. Deline closed the lid
firmly. &ldquo;I thought I might need it if I should sit on
the damp ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hungry as bears, Penny and Louise did not try
to curb their healthy, young appetites. Mrs. Deline,
on the other hand, scarcely nibbled at the food. Several
times she arose and paced nervously to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing dark and I should return to the
hotel,&rdquo; she said the instant the girls had finished eating.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not bother to repack the lunch basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll help you pick up everything,&rdquo; Penny
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t bother. I&rsquo;ll merely pay the hotel
for the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was convinced that Mrs. Deline deliberately
intended to leave the hamper behind. Despite the
deep inroads she and Louise had made, considerable
food remained. It occurred to her that the widow
hoped to leave what remained so that the person hiding
in the woods might come to the cabin for it after
the party had gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with a heavy basket,&rdquo; Mrs.
Deline said impatiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just leave it on the
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the rangers wouldn&rsquo;t like to have us leave
food here,&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;It will only take a
minute to clean up everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disregarding Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s order, she began to repack
the remains of the lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t wish to carry the basket all the way
to the hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise and I will help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tossing her head, Mrs. Deline walked out of the
cabin, allowing the door to slam behind her. Louise
and Penny finished packing the lunch and hastened
down the trail in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t cross her so,&rdquo; Louise whispered
uneasily. &ldquo;I think she intended to meet someone
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;We spiked her
little plan. I have an idea who she intended to meet
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could not answer, for by this time she and
Louise were practically at Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s heels. The
widow was walking as fast as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to keep the basket,&rdquo; she told the girls
irritably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll never carry it back to the
hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>All the way to the Parker camp Mrs. Deline ignored
Penny and Louise. And as they bade her
goodbye, she barely responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we drive you down to the hotel in the car?&rdquo;
Penny offered, feeling slightly ashamed of her actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; the widow answered icily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done quite enough for one day.&rdquo; She vanished
down the darkening road.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Deline was beyond view, the girls retraced
their way to the spring for the water bucket.
As they approached, they thought for a moment that
they heard retreating footsteps. The realization that
they were alone in the woods, made them a bit nervous.
Hurriedly they recovered the bucket and carried
it to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me what you think, Penny!&rdquo; Louise
commanded when they were inside the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s clear as crystal.&rdquo; Penny struck a match
to the wick of the gasoline lantern and hung it on a
hook of the tent pole. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline went to the
cabin intending to meet someone. She carried extra
food, a blanket, and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, clothing for
a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought she signaled from the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she did, Lou. She warned the person,
whoever he was, not to approach. She hoped by
leaving the basket behind to get it into his hands after
we&rsquo;d gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You thwarted her in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did together,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. Her face
suddenly became sober. &ldquo;Lou&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just occurred to me! Maybe the man she intended
to meet was the same fellow who stole food
from our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible. But why should Mrs. Deline be
interested in a common tramp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know that fellow was a tramp?&rdquo;
Penny speculated. &ldquo;Jerry told us about a young soldier
that had escaped from a Canadian prison camp.
Mrs. Deline may be trying to help him by supplying
food and heavy clothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As usual, Penny, aren&rsquo;t you leaping to hasty conclusions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am, but everything fits in beautifully.
I&rsquo;ve thought from the first that Mrs. Deline was nothing
less than a spy or an international crook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve aired that theory before,&rdquo; Louise said,
stretching out on the cot. &ldquo;Wonder when your
father will get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would come,&rdquo; Penny replied, glancing
anxiously toward the road. &ldquo;At least I have one consolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s not with Mrs. Deline. Oh, Lou,
think how horrible it would be to have a spy for a
stepmother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be something different anyhow,&rdquo; Louise
chuckled. &ldquo;Want to listen to the radio awhile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Penny agreed, &ldquo;maybe we can tune in
that outlaw station. It&rsquo;s about time for the regular
nightly broadcast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closing themselves into the car, the girls tried without
success to get the outlaw shortwave station.
Tuning instead to a dance orchestra, they discussed
the day&rsquo;s happenings and made elaborate plans for
the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really going to work,&rdquo; Penny announced
grimly. &ldquo;No Mrs. Deline ever will outwit me! Our
first job must be to find that package she buried in
the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the person hiding in the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rangers ought to take over that part.&rdquo; Penny
peered out through the car window at the dark
woods which hemmed in the camp. &ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; she
admitted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of being here at night.
I&rsquo;m not exactly afraid, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Louise ordered sharply, &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s
coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny snapped off the radio. Tensely, the girls
watched the road. The next instant they relaxed,
for it was Mr. Parker who trudged wearily up the
slope. Seeing Penny and Louise in the car, he came
over to apologize for being so late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with Jerry for the past two hours,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;Time went faster than I realized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not about the radio station if that&rsquo;s what you
mean. The fellow got away with his portable outfit
slick as a whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authorities have no idea who the man is,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest. So far they&rsquo;ve not been able
to break the code he uses either. But in time they&rsquo;ll
get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gleaned what information they could from
Mr. Parker, the girls related their own adventure. As
they fully expected, he made light of the episode at
the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Mrs. Deline expect to meet anyone
there?&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Penny, I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t
understand her and misinterpret her actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand her, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to a man loitering about the camp,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
resumed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worried about that ever since
food was stolen. As I must be gone so much of the
time, why wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for us to move to
the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stiffened for an argument, and then suddenly
changed her mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dad,&rdquo; she astonished him by saying,
&ldquo;as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, we can move tomorrow.
I&rsquo;ve had enough of the lonesome life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Mr. Parker said heartily.
&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had moved on, to sit for awhile by the
dying embers of the fire, Louise remarked to Penny
that explanations were in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come you&rsquo;re ready to desert the rough and
rugged life?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;At first you were
dead set against moving into the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny carefully raised the car window so that her
father would not overhear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in fighting the Enemy on his own territory,&rdquo;
she explained elaborately. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline will
bear watching. I intend to devote all my waking
hours to the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Jerry has nothing to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to move to the hotel so you&rsquo;d
see more of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; Penny scoffed. &ldquo;Whoever
thought of such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did or I&rsquo;m no mind reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it may have crossed my mind,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged
with a giggle. &ldquo;In fact, I can see quite
a few advantages to hotel life. With luck we&rsquo;ll yet
make something of this vacation!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>VISITORS NOT PERMITTED</i></h2>
<p>Penny stood before the mirror in the hotel
room and struggled to coax a little curl into her damp
hair. She and Louise had spent two hours splashing
in the surf that morning. The salt water had tightened
their skins and produced discouraging results
with their tresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place does have it over a forest camp,&rdquo; Penny
said, gazing about the comfortably furnished room
she shared with Louise. Her father&rsquo;s room was three
doors down the hall. &ldquo;A shower bath, no meals to
cook, no dishes to wash, and the sea at one&rsquo;s elbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it better,&rdquo; replied Louise. She had curled up
kitten fashion on the bed and was making deep inroads
into a box of chocolates. &ldquo;So far though, we&rsquo;ve
not done much fancy sleuthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only been here a few hours. Where do
you suppose Mrs. Deline keeps herself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In her room no doubt. Why do you worry about
her so much, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny twisted a few ringlets over her finger and
abandoned the project as hopeless. &ldquo;Lou, you know
all the prize answers without asking me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you a dozen times why I distrust that
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it all simmer down to one thing? You&rsquo;re
jealous as a green-eyed cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do dislike her,&rdquo; Penny grinned. &ldquo;On
second thought, I&rsquo;m sure of it! But facts are facts
and have nothing to do with my personal feelings. In
the first place, didn&rsquo;t she get Dad to bring her with
us to Sunset Beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does that prove? She has no car of her
own and the trains are so crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she knew that Dad was coming here to
try to dig up a story about the outlaw radio station,&rdquo;
Penny went on, unruffled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably pumped
him of information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father knows how to look after himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>he</i> thinks!&rdquo; Penny muttered. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t place any wagers on it myself. Why, he&rsquo;s
been as blind as a bat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you see enough for two or three people,&rdquo;
Louise chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, didn&rsquo;t I, how that vampire tried to
steal our car while we were on our way here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three times, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would bear repeating. I think she intended
to meet someone that night&mdash;perhaps the
same person who was hiding in the woods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise, methodically eating chocolates, mulled over
the possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry told us that an escaped flier from a Canadian
prison camp may be hiding somewhere near here,&rdquo;
Penny resumed, wandering to the window. &ldquo;Perhaps
Mrs. Deline is trying to help him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a new theory every minute,&rdquo; Louise
yawned. &ldquo;Why not think up one and stick to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not answer for at that moment she observed
Jerry Livingston leaving the veranda of the
hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Lou!&rdquo; she cried, jerking her chum off
the bed. &ldquo;I want to see Jerry before he escapes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about Mrs. Deline pursuing your defenseless
father!&rdquo; Louise protested as she was pulled down the
hall to the elevator. &ldquo;Her tactics at least are more
subtle than yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is different,&rdquo; Penny retorted shamelessly.
&ldquo;Jerry and I are old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging through the revolving doors of the hotel,
the girls raced after Jerry. Breathless from running,
they finally overtook him far down the boardwalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello,&rdquo; he greeted them with a broad smile.
&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;ve moved into the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lock, stock and barrel,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;We
want to be in the thick of things. Any news about
the radio station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can report, I&rsquo;m on my way now to
Intercept Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Dad this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a few minutes. He&rsquo;s doing a little special
work for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s for you and not Mrs. Deline,&rdquo;
Penny said stiffly. &ldquo;Jerry, there are some things you
should know about that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you unburden your heart,&rdquo; Jerry invited,
seating himself on a sand dune. &ldquo;I have about ten
minutes to listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage her,&rdquo; sighed Louise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
slightly cracked on the subject, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, Penny has ideas at times,&rdquo; Jerry paid
her tribute. &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking like a whirlwind, Penny delved deeply
into the subject of Mrs. Deline. She repeated how
the widow had buried a package in the sand, but it
was not until the episode of the cabin was described
that Jerry really seemed interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, at first I didn&rsquo;t take your Mrs. Deline talk
very seriously,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Perhaps you have
something after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you reported to the park rangers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad may have seen them, I&rsquo;m not sure. We left
camp in a big rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take care of that, Penny. We&rsquo;ll have
the park searched again and try to find that fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do believe he&rsquo;s the escaped flier!&rdquo;
Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; was Jerry&rsquo;s discouraging reply.
&ldquo;Nevertheless, we can&rsquo;t afford to overlook any possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the package in the sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember where it was buried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approximately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have time to go with you now,&rdquo; Jerry said,
looking at his wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise and I haven&rsquo;t much to do this morning.
We&rsquo;ll be glad to search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Jerry urged. &ldquo;If you fail then I can
take over. The important thing is not to tip off your
hand. Don&rsquo;t let anyone suspect what you&rsquo;re about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise nodded soberly. They felt
rather important to have been assigned a definite task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Report to me as soon as you find that package,&rdquo;
Jerry urged as he started on. &ldquo;It may contain something
of vital importance. It may not. We&rsquo;ll withhold
judgment until we have the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left to themselves, the girls lost not a moment in
hastening to the section of beach where Mrs. Deline
had been seen to bury the package.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now just where was it?&rdquo; Penny asked, gazing
about the deserted dunes. &ldquo;What became of our
marker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left a stick to show the exact spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sign of it now. What wretched luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the girls knew the general locality where
the package had been buried, all of the dunes looked
discouragingly alike. Not a footprint remained to
guide them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent Mrs. Deline came back here and
removed that stick!&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;Maybe she
dug up the package too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone could have taken the stick. Why do you
think she did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she watched us digging for the package.
Well, let&rsquo;s look for it anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With none too much enthusiasm, the girls set to
work. The tide was much lower than upon their last
visit and the shoreline did not look the same. Nor
could they agree within forty feet of the right place
to dig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try one dune, and I&rsquo;ll work on another,&rdquo;
Penny offered as a compromise.</p>
<p>An hour of unavailing work found the pair too discouraged
to keep on digging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is the right place, Mrs. Deline or someone
has removed the package,&rdquo; Penny declared, sinking
back on her heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well give up,&rdquo; Louise added wearily.</p>
<p>Penny slid down the dune and emptied sand from
her shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be an easy way to beat Mrs. Deline
at her own little game,&rdquo; she remarked thoughtfully.
&ldquo;For instance, why does she always wear that jade
green charm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she likes it I&rsquo;d imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d take it off at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she does, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the night I was with her. I distinctly gained
the impression that there was something about it she
was afraid I&rsquo;d see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message contained inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s been my theory from the first, Lou. Now
if only we could lay our hands on the charm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding the package would be a lot easier. We
can&rsquo;t waylay the woman and take the jade elephant
by force. Or can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Penny agreed reluctantly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
Dad would like that. And there&rsquo;s always the possibility
I might be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The probability, you mean,&rdquo; corrected Louise.</p>
<p>Penny retied her shoes and glanced toward the
hotel. Far up the beach she saw Mrs. Deline, and
the widow was walking slowly toward the sand
dunes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Duck!&rdquo; Penny ordered, rolling over one of the
high ridges. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want her to see us here. She&rsquo;ll
suspect what we&rsquo;ve been up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise crouched behind the dune with her chum,
though she complained that she felt silly doing it.
Apparently, Mrs. Deline had not seen the girls. She
came steadily on.</p>
<p>Drawing close, she peered directly at the dune
where the girls had taken refuge. For a second they
feared that she had seen them. But she passed on
without another glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as though she&rsquo;s on her way to the
lighthouse again,&rdquo; Penny remarked after Mrs. Deline
was far down the beach. &ldquo;Wonder why she goes
there so often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought visitors weren&rsquo;t allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the rules they&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From behind the dune, the girls kept watch of the
widow. Presently they saw her climb the steps of
the lighthouse and disappear into the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settles what?&rdquo; Louise straightened up, brushing
sand from her skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Deline can get into that lighthouse, so
can I. We&rsquo;ll make an issue of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today,&rdquo; said Louise dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right now!&rdquo; Penny corrected, starting down the
beach. &ldquo;That lighthouse is government property,
and as citizens we have certain rights. Let&rsquo;s assert
them and see what happens!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>INSIDE THE LIGHTHOUSE</i></h2>
<p>Unchallenged, Penny and Louise reached
the base of the lighthouse. But as they slowly
climbed the iron stairs, their courage fast slipped
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we say to the keeper?&rdquo; Louise faltered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve even forgotten his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jim McCoy. If
Mrs. Deline is allowed inside the tower, shouldn&rsquo;t
we have the same privileges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a personal friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should make no difference,&rdquo; Penny argued.
&ldquo;This is government property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not do it,&rdquo; Louise pleaded, holding back.</p>
<p>Having proceeded so far. Penny was in no mood to
retreat. Quickly, lest she too lose her courage, she
rapped hard on the tower door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Minutes elapsed. Then the heavy oak door swung
back and Jim McCoy, the burly keeper, peered out
at the girls. His bushy brows drew together in an
angry scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here again!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Penny, making the word crisp and firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to report you if you keep pestering me,&rdquo;
the keeper scolded. &ldquo;How many times have I told
you no visitors are allowed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t treat everyone the same!&rdquo; Penny
remonstrated. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline just came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline? Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a woman who stays at the hotel. She came
through this door not five minutes ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have imagined it. I&rsquo;ve had no visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s silence said more plainly than words that
she did not believe the keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think I&rsquo;m lying, eh?&rdquo; he demanded unpleasantly.
&ldquo;Okay, come in and see for yourselves.
I&rsquo;m breaking a rule to invite you into the tower, but
maybe then you&rsquo;ll be satisfied and quite bothering me.
We have work to do here, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keeper stepped aside so that the girls might
enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My living quarters,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;You see,
I have no visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Decidedly ill at ease, the girls gazed about the little
circular room. The walls were lined with built-in
cupboards. Nearly all of the furniture had been
made with a view to conserving space. As Mr.
McCoy had said, there were no visitors&mdash;no evidence
that Mrs. Deline ever had been there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; the keeper demanded unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were sure Mrs. Deline came here,&rdquo; Penny
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been no one today except early this morning
when a government inspector paid me a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not believe the man but she deemed it
wise to appear to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she apologized. &ldquo;I guess we have
made nuisances of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the keeper said in a less unfriendly
tone. &ldquo;Kids are kids. Now that you&rsquo;re
here, look around a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; Louise replied gratefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to see the inside of a lighthouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some work to do,&rdquo; Mr. McCoy announced.
&ldquo;The light&rsquo;s not been operating right and I&rsquo;m trying
to get the mechanism adjusted. I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out, allowing the door to slam hard.</p>
<p>The girls surveyed their surroundings with keen
interest. On a table near the window there was a
shortwave radio. A circular couch occupied another
curving corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of Mrs. Deline?&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;She certainly came here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she did! We saw her plain as day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be somewhere in the tower. Probably
there&rsquo;s a room above this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tiptoed to the door and tried to open it.
To her surprise and chagrin, it would not budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Great Aunt!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re locked
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the door&rsquo;s just stuck.&rdquo; Louise strode
across the room to help Penny. Both of them tried
without success to open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s shout and pound!&rdquo; Louise suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait! I think we&rsquo;ve been locked in here on
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get nervous. The keeper&rsquo;s no fool.
He&rsquo;ll have to let us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he lock us in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s provoked at us for one reason, Lou.
Another, something&rsquo;s going on here that he doesn&rsquo;t
want us to know about. He and Mrs. Deline may
be having a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in the room above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s listen. Maybe we can overhear their
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and fell silent. Though the girls
listened for a long while, no sound reached their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a nice situation!&rdquo; Louise fumed. &ldquo;I think
the door locked itself. We ought to shout for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goose, a door doesn&rsquo;t lock itself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This one might have a trick catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Jim McCoy who accomplished the
trick,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;Listen! Someone&rsquo;s coming
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly the girls could hear footsteps on the iron
balcony outside the door. A moment later they were
able to distinguish a murmur of men&rsquo;s voices. The
footsteps moved on and a moment later they heard
a door close overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another visitor!&rdquo; Penny announced. &ldquo;Did you
hear what was said, Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t make out a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor could I. But that voice sounded familiar.
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve heard it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the same feeling, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls listened intently, hoping to overhear conversation
on the floor above. However, the walls of
the lighthouse were so thick that not a word reached
them. Now and then they thought they heard Mrs.
Deline&rsquo;s high pitched voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise, it&rsquo;s just come to me!&rdquo; Penny whispered
a moment later. &ldquo;I believe Mr. McCoy&rsquo;s visitor may
be George Emory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice did sound a little like his. But why
would he come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ve under-rated George Emory. Why,
all this time he may have been trying to get information
from us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did ask us quite a few questions, particularly
about your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he seemed to know a lot about that outlaw
radio station, Lou. Maybe he tried to throw us off
the track by suggesting that we watch old Jake Skagway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly fell for it, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did, if you assume that George Emory is upstairs
having a conference with Mrs. Deline and the
lighthouse keeper. But we&rsquo;re not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not, Penny. One easily can be mistaken
in voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determined to hear more, Penny cautiously
climbed up on the radio table, so that her head and
ear were close to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make out anything?&rdquo; Louise whispered.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head in disgust. After a few
minutes she dropped lightly down from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walls are too thick,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I could
hear three voices though. Two were men and the
other, a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mrs. Deline must be here. The keeper lied
about that part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the girls heard footsteps again on the iron
stairway. They moved to the window, hoping to
see whomever was descending from the room above.
However, the little round aperture was so situated
that it gave a view of only one side of the Point.
They could not see the stairway nor the stretch of
beach leading to the hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly learning a lot!&rdquo; Louise said
crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this. Let&rsquo;s shout for
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Penny agreed. &ldquo;We may as well find
out whether or not we&rsquo;re prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crossing to the heavy oak door, she pounded hard
on the panels. Almost at once the girls heard someone
coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let on what we suspect,&rdquo; Penny warned her
companion.</p>
<p>The next moment the door swung open to admit
the keeper of the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>A LOCKED DOOR</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I was gone a little longer than I meant to be,&rdquo; Jim
McCoy apologized as he came into the room. &ldquo;Did
I keep you waiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We probably wouldn&rsquo;t have waited if you hadn&rsquo;t
locked the door!&rdquo; Louise said sharply.</p>
<p>The keeper&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted and he looked slightly
amused. &ldquo;Locked in?&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we couldn&rsquo;t get the door open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it sticks sometimes. Been intending to fix
it for several days. If you had pushed hard it would
have opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly pushed hard enough,&rdquo; Penny said
dryly. She was more than ever certain that the lighthouse
keeper had unlocked the door only a moment
before entering. Clearly, he had meant to prevent
Louise and her from seeing and hearing what went
on in the room above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; the keeper invited. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
the tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo; Penny replied coldly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
spent so much time here that we&rsquo;ll have to be getting
back to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like.&rdquo; The keeper shrugged, and looked
relieved by the decision.</p>
<p>Jim McCoy stepped away from the door, and the
girls hastened down the iron stairway. No one was
in sight on the beach. Whoever had visited the lighthouse
during the time they were imprisoned, had disappeared.</p>
<p>When they were well down the beach, Louise and
Penny slackened their pace. Glancing back they saw
that the keeper of the light still stood on the tiny iron
balcony watching them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man gives me the creeps,&rdquo; Louise remarked.
&ldquo;Did you believe what he said about the door sticking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; Penny returned with emphasis. &ldquo;I
think he locked us in on purpose, probably because
he was expecting visitors and didn&rsquo;t want us to see
too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it turned out we didn&rsquo;t learn a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no proof of anything,&rdquo; Penny admitted
slowly. &ldquo;Nevertheless, we&rsquo;re pretty sure Mrs. Deline
visited the tower.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;George Emory too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That part is pure guess,&rdquo; Penny said, &ldquo;so we don&rsquo;t
dare consider it too seriously. Did you ever see Mrs.
Deline with George Emory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. But then, we&rsquo;ve not been at the hotel
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find Jerry or Dad,&rdquo; Penny said abruptly.
&ldquo;We ought to report to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the hotel, the girls looked in vain for
Mr. Parker. The publisher was not in his room nor
anywhere in the lobby. Jerry apparently had not
returned from Intercept Headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mrs. Deline,&rdquo; Louise whispered, jerking
her head toward a high-backed chair not far from
the elevator.</p>
<p>The widow was reading a newspaper. If she saw
the girls she paid no attention to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk to her and see what we can learn,&rdquo;
Louise suggested.</p>
<p>Penny had another thought. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she vetoed the
suggestion. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline would be more likely to
learn things from us. That woman is clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. Deline arose, picked up her purse,
and went out the front door of the hotel. On their
way to the elevator. Penny and Louise noticed that
the woman carelessly had left a handkerchief and her
room key lying on the chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn them in at the desk,&rdquo; Louise said, picking
up the articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise glanced at her chum in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea!&rdquo; Penny revealed, lowering her
voice. &ldquo;Are you game to try something risky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This chance is tailor-made for us!&rdquo; Penny went
on. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline simply handed her room key over
to us. Let&rsquo;s use our opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter her room?&rdquo; Louise asked, shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? FBI agents think nothing of examining
the belongings of a suspected person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not FBI agents, Penny. I don&rsquo;t want
to do it without asking Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that time it will be too late. It&rsquo;s now or
never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline might catch us in the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;ll have to take.&rdquo; Penny, in
possession of the room key, walked to the front door
of the hotel. She was reassured to see that Mrs.
Deline had seated herself on a bench some distance
from the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; Penny reported, coming back
to Louise. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose so,&rdquo; Louise consented nervously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>An elevator shot the girls up to the fourth floor.
To locate Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s room required but a moment,
and the halls fortunately were deserted. Penny fitted
the key into the lock and pushed open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work fast,&rdquo; she said, closing it behind
them again.</p>
<p>The room was in perfect order. Only a few toilet
articles had been set out on the dresser. Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s
suitcase was only half unpacked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if the widow is holding herself
ready to fly at a moment&rsquo;s notice,&rdquo; Penny commented.
&ldquo;Otherwise, why didn&rsquo;t she unpack everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you expect to find here?&rdquo; Louise asked
nervously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over with fast, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start with the bureau drawers,&rdquo; Penny instructed.
&ldquo;Search for any papers, letters or the sort. I&rsquo;ll go
through the suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully the girls began examining Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s
personal belongings. Almost at once Louise reported
that the bureau contained nothing of interest. Penny,
however, had more luck. She came upon a pearl-handled
revolver buried beneath a pile of silk underclothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; she whispered, touching the weapon
gingerly. &ldquo;Now will you believe me when I say
that the widow isn&rsquo;t the sweet little girl she&rsquo;d have
us believe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s eyes had opened wide at sight of the revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s that white suit she wore!&rdquo; Penny
cried, lifting out a folded garment from the suitcase.
&ldquo;Look, Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the skirt of the suit had been cut a neat,
square hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the meaning of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline wrote something on the skirt&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you remember? Probably she used a pen with invisible
ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why on her skirt, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d just been to the lighthouse. Perhaps she
learned something there and she wanted to write it
down before she forgot. Possibly she didn&rsquo;t have
any paper. Then when she got back here, she either
destroyed the message, or sent it to someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Louise said doubtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all so fantastic. I wouldn&rsquo;t believe a bit of it except
for this revolver. Having it doesn&rsquo;t look so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget the green elephant charm,&rdquo;
Penny reminded her. &ldquo;I wish we could find it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance. Mrs. Deline always wears it around
her neck. She had it on today. I noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Time fast was elapsing and the girls were worried
lest someone discover them in the room. Hastily they
replaced everything as they had found it, and relocking
the door, stepped out into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our next move?&rdquo; Louise asked as they
buzzed for a down-going elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell Jerry and Dad, of course. But before
that, there&rsquo;s one thing I wish we could do, Lou. It
would give everything we have to report a more
substantial basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get our hands on the jade green
elephant? I&rsquo;ve a hunch that it contains something
important&mdash;perhaps evidence that would crack the
case wide open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just how do you propose that we acquire the
charm?&rdquo; Louise asked sarcastically. &ldquo;Are we to waylay
Mrs. Deline and take it by force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way to get it. Mrs. Deline wears
that charm as if it were her skin. I&rsquo;ve never seen her
without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator was coming down so Penny spoke
hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a way,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;if only it will
work. Think we could get Mrs. Deline to go bathing
in the surf with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ruin that lovely hair-do? Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, it&rsquo;s worth trying,&rdquo; Penny urged.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to our room now and get our bathing suits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any point in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; Penny laughed, entering the elevator.
&ldquo;If my little plan works we&rsquo;ll have keen sport and
maybe do our country a good turn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>

<br /><i>NYMPHS OF THE SEA</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How you expect to get Mrs. Deline to go swimming
with us is beyond me!&rdquo; Louise opined as she
and Penny left the hotel, their bathing suits swinging
over their arms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none too warm today. She
dislikes us both intensely. Furthermore, she never
swims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other reasons?&rdquo; Penny asked cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait and watch,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;I just
hope she doesn&rsquo;t suspect we&rsquo;ve been prowling in her
room. If she got wise to that she&rsquo;d report us to the
hotel management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving the hotel the girls had taken care
to drop the room key in the chair where Mrs. Deline
had left it. They were confident that no one had
seen them take the key or enter the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The widow remained as the girls last had seen her.
She was sitting on a bench facing the sea, her gaze
fixed on the deep blue line of the horizon. As the
girls passed beside her, she looked up, frowning
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way to the bath house,&rdquo; said Penny,
her tone implying that the matter was one of great
importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s voice barely was polite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to come with us?&rdquo; Louise invited
cordially.</p>
<p>The invitation took Mrs. Deline by surprise. &ldquo;No,
thank you,&rdquo; she declined. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll teach you,&rdquo; offered Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind. I don&rsquo;t care for the water. I
particularly detest cold water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air is warming up,&rdquo; Penny tried to encourage
her. &ldquo;Why not try it with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could induce me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise nodded grimly, as much as to say that she
had known how it would be. Penny would not give
up. She decided to adopt drastic measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t suppose you would go into the
water,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably afraid you&rsquo;ll get
salt water on that lovely skin of yours, or muss up
your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Deline. &ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the reason?&rdquo; Penny pursued ruthlessly.
&ldquo;You have to protect your beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the reason!&rdquo; Mrs. Deline snapped.
&ldquo;If I had a bathing suit, I&rsquo;d show you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can use mine,&rdquo; Penny said promptly. &ldquo;Louise
has an extra one she&rsquo;ll let me have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline looked trapped and angry. She sprang
to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go swimming!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;If
I catch pneumonia I suppose you&rsquo;ll be satisfied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll love the water once you&rsquo;re in,&rdquo; Penny
said sweetly. &ldquo;The bath house is this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline spent so long getting into the borrowed
suit that the girls began to fear she had outwitted
them. But just as they were ready to give
up, the woman came out of the dressing room.
Penny&rsquo;s suit was a size too small for her so that she
looked as if she had been poured into it. Her legs
were skinny, her hips bulged. She still wore the elephant
charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish Dad could see her now!&rdquo; Penny muttered.
&ldquo;What a disillusionment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the girls, Mrs. Deline walked stiffly toward
the surf. A wave rolled in, wetting her to the
knees. Mrs. Deline shrieked and backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s freezing!&rdquo; she complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to get wet all at once,&rdquo; Penny instructed
kindly. &ldquo;This way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seized Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s hand and pulled her toward
the deeper water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; Mrs. Deline protested, trying to
shake free. &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny held fast to her hand. A big roller broke
over their heads. Mrs. Deline sputtered and choked
and struggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is dreadful!&rdquo; she whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to watch for the waves and jump just
as they strike you,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaped, but the widow mistimed the roller. It
struck her a resounding whack on her shoulders and
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes another!&rdquo; warned Louise. &ldquo;A big
one too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline broke away from Penny. She started
to run for shore. The big roller overtook her, sweeping
her from her feet.</p>
<p>This was the opportunity that Penny awaited.
Pretending that she too had lost her balance, she allowed
the tide to carry her straight into Mrs. Deline.
For an instant they both were beneath the surface of
the water.</p>
<p>Penny worked fast. Clutching Mrs. Deline as if
in terror, she yanked hard at the slender chain that
held the green elephant charm. It snapped and the
jade piece came off into her hands. Deftly she thrust
the charm into the front of her bathing suit. Then
she popped up above the water, winking at Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Mrs. Deline scrambled to her feet, clutching at the
broken chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; she accused Penny. &ldquo;You
pulled it apart. My beautiful charm has fallen into
the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help you look for it,&rdquo; Louise offered, darting
forward.</p>
<p>As the pair were groping about on the sandy floor,
another wave rolled in. Penny neglected to warn
Mrs. Deline. It struck her from behind, toppling her
over on her face. Her cap slipped awry and she
swallowed salt water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t stand any more of this!&rdquo; she spluttered.
&ldquo;It was cruel of you to get me to come into the surf!
Now I&rsquo;ve lost my charm, and it was all your fault,
Penny Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you another ornament,&rdquo; the girl offered.
Seeing Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s distress she felt a bit ashamed of
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another ornament!&rdquo; the widow mocked. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want another! I want the one I&rsquo;ve lost. It&rsquo;s
of vital importance to me to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline made another futile search for the
charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been washed away,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
find it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glaring furiously at Penny, she turned and fled to
the bath house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did she really lose the charm?&rdquo; Louise demanded
the moment the girls were alone. &ldquo;Or did you get
it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny answered by producing the green elephant
charm from the front of her bathing suit where she
had hidden it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy as taking candy from a babe,&rdquo; she chuckled.
&ldquo;My, but was she hopping mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not be laughing if your father hears
about this,&rdquo; Louise warned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s apt to look at
matters from a different angle than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny skipped through the shallow water and sat
down on the beach well beyond the reach of the
waves. Louise flopped beside her. Eagerly they examined
the jade green trinket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like any ordinary charm to me,&rdquo; Louise
remarked. &ldquo;No special carving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should open,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;The first night
when Mrs. Deline and I shared a room, I was sure I
saw her close it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise turned the charm over and pried at it with
a hairpin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does have a back lid!&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly.
&ldquo;Penny, I think it&rsquo;s going to open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say magic words while you work,&rdquo; Penny
laughed. &ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll keep watch of the bath
house. We don&rsquo;t want Mrs. Deline to pop out here
and see us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Louise pried again at the lid of the charm. It gave
suddenly.</p>
<p>Inside the tiny cavity was a folded piece of paper.
While Louise stared in delighted awe, Penny gained
possession. With nervous haste she unfolded the
paper. She gazed at it a moment and her face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t make anything of the writing!&rdquo; she
declared in disappointment. &ldquo;The words don&rsquo;t make
sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a mess of letters,&rdquo; Louise agreed, peering
over her shoulder.</p>
<p>The girls were decidedly let-down for they had
gone to much trouble and risk to obtain the jade ornament.
But Penny&rsquo;s disappointment did not last long.
As she stared at the paper, its significance dawned
upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is important, Lou!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Maybe
we&rsquo;ve stumbled into something big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Penny demanded triumphantly.
&ldquo;The letters, of this message must comprise a secret
code! If only we can break it down we may learn
all we need to know about Mrs. Deline and her
strange friends!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>THE CARDBOARD BOX</i></h2>
<p>While Penny and Louise were puzzling over the
strange writing found inside the jade charm, Mrs.
Deline appeared in the doorway of the bath house.
Barely in time to escape detection, the girls hid the
tiny elephant and the paper in the sand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline crossed the beach to speak to the girls.
Her hair was damp and stringy, her face pinched
and blue from cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your suit!&rdquo; she snapped, slapping the wet
garment into the sand at Penny&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;I hope you
enjoyed the swim! I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning her back, the widow marched to the hotel.</p>
<p>The moment Mrs. Deline had disappeared into the
white brick building, Penny dug the jade elephant
and paper from the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get dressed,&rdquo; she urged Louise. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no
time to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>So thrilled were the girls over what they had accomplished
that they could talk of nothing else.
Penny felt that by obtaining the jade elephant she
had proven her case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought I was only jealous of Mrs. Deline,&rdquo;
she told Louise triumphantly as they dressed in adjoining
booths. &ldquo;Now what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re a genius!&rdquo; Louise praised. &ldquo;Mrs.
Deline certainly is mixed up in some shady business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once dressed, the girls wrapped the jade elephant
in a handkerchief and carried it to the hotel. Jerry
was nowhere to be found, and a bellboy told Penny
that her father had gone for a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can work the message out ourselves,&rdquo;
Penny suggested hopefully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their hotel room, the girls spent an hour attempting
to decipher the strange jargon of letters appearing
on the paper. At the end of that time. Penny tossed
aside her pencil in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a job for an expert,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I certainly
don&rsquo;t classify as one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone jingled. Penny answered it and
was delighted to hear Jerry&rsquo;s familiar voice. He was
down in the lobby and had been told that the girls
wished to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do!&rdquo; Penny answered gaily. &ldquo;Hold
everything! We&rsquo;ll be with you in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>The elevator being entirely too slow, the girls raced
down the stairs. Breathlessly they started to tell
Jerry what they had learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside
where we won&rsquo;t be overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once out in the open with no one close by, Jerry
lent an attentive ear to Penny&rsquo;s tale of their afternoon
adventure. He did not have much to say in
return, but he studied the jade green elephant and
the paper with deep interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything?&rdquo; Penny asked in
disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, it may be something of very
great importance,&rdquo; he returned soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
this to Headquarters. We have an expert on codes
who should be able to break it in a short while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls hoped that Jerry would invite them to
accompany him, but he did not do so. Instead he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you were telling me that Mrs. Deline had
buried a package in the sand. Any luck in finding it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that she went back there and dug
it up herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see any footprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you mark the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a stick that someone removed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very reliable way to take observations,&rdquo;
Jerry remarked. &ldquo;Ever try the clock system?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls looked blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; Jerry illustrated, &ldquo;imagine that the
landscape is like the face of a clock. Now what do
you see on the hour of two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Louise complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do!&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;A big tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Jerry. &ldquo;And at the hour
of six?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a signboard!&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;At the
hour of seven there&rsquo;s a big sand dune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you picture things in your mind as if they&rsquo;re
on the face of a clock it&rsquo;s much easier to remember
and keep them in proper proportion. Now, using
that same system can you recall anything more about
the place where Mrs. Deline buried the package?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take
notations at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of signboards, I remember one,&rdquo; Louise
said thoughtfully. &ldquo;It was a long distance back from
the beach, slightly to the right. A cigarette advertisement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; agreed Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that will help some,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to find the package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe Mrs. Deline is an Enemy
Agent?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought so for quite a while now,&rdquo; Jerry admitted.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it for fear of building up your
hopes. Anyhow, we&rsquo;ve got to work quietly in this
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Dad,&rdquo; Penny murmured, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will
break him up to learn the truth. Do you say I should
tell him right away, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jerry demanded, his eyes amused.
&ldquo;Your father may have a few things to break to you
too, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let your father do his own talking,&rdquo; Jerry said,
getting up from the hotel bench. &ldquo;Have to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Penny pleaded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not told us anything.
Do you think Mrs. Deline has been aiding that
flier who escaped from a Canadian prison camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry deliberately let the question pass. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
he said urgently. &ldquo;I may not see you girls again until
after dinner. Want to help me tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to lead me to the place where Mrs.
Deline buried that package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if I don&rsquo;t see you earlier, meet me here at
nine o&rsquo;clock. It should be dark by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; Penny promised, her eyes glowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>At dinner that night the girls told Mr. Parker of
their appointment to meet Jerry. Penny would have
explained about the package, but before she could
do so, Mrs. Deline joined the group. Mr. Parker
immediately invited her to dine with them. To the
annoyance of Penny and Louise she accepted with
alacrity.</p>
<p>The girls fully expected that Mrs. Deline would
make some reference to the incident of the afternoon.
Instead she avoided the subject, talking of her experiences
in China and the Orient. Despite their
prejudice, Penny and Louise were compelled in all
honesty to acknowledge to themselves that the widow
was a brilliant, entertaining conversationalist.</p>
<p>Over the coffee cups Mrs. Deline spoke casually of
a play which was showing at the local theatre. Before
Penny could say a word, Mr. Parker had suggested
that he buy tickets for the night&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to go,&rdquo; Mrs. Deline accepted instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Mr. Parker, approved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get four
tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Penny corrected grimly. &ldquo;Louise and I
already have an appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Mr. Parker recalled belatedly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline looked so pleased that Penny was
sorely tempted to abandon the meeting with Jerry.
Only the realization that the task ahead was vitally
important, kept her silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock Mr. Parker and Mrs. Deline left
the hotel for the theatre. With an hour to kill, Penny
and Louise were very restless. They read the evening
paper and watched the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an interesting news item,&rdquo; Penny remarked,
indicating a brief story on an inner page of the paper.
&ldquo;It says an enemy submarine was sighted not many
miles from here&mdash;just off the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they get it?&rdquo; Louise inquired absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not. The story doesn&rsquo;t say, except that
the air patrol dropped bombs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what a single sub was doing so close
here?&rdquo; Louise speculated. &ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ve nothing
to fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clock chimed the hour of nine. On the first
stroke, the girls arose and hastened to keep their appointment
with Jerry. The night was closing in
dark. Along the shore no lights were showing for
the dim-out was rigidly enforced at Sunset Beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jerry?&rdquo; Penny asked as they reached the
bench where they had promised to meet him. &ldquo;Hope
he didn&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes elapsed. Penny was examining the
luminous dial of her wrist watch when someone came
striding down the gravel path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Jerry greeted the girls. &ldquo;Sorry to have
kept you waiting. All set for adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; Penny laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Taking each of them by an elbow, Jerry guided
the girls down the deserted beach. Twice they passed
guards who merely stared and allowed them to pass
unchallenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news about that code?&rdquo; Penny questioned as
they walked along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough one to break,&rdquo; Jerry replied briefly.
&ldquo;Experts have been trying to take it apart ever since
I left you girls this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it really is something?&rdquo; Penny asked,
scarcely daring to hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; Jerry replied heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
pretty sure now that Mrs. Deline is mixed up in a
bad business. But we can&rsquo;t act until we know absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a horrible shock to Dad,&rdquo; Penny remarked.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at the theatre with Mrs. Deline now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least she&rsquo;s out of the way, so there&rsquo;s no chance
she&rsquo;ll see us at work,&rdquo; Jerry commented. &ldquo;Think
you can find the place to dig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had marked it well in her mind, but at night
everything looked different. After some uncertainty,
the girls agreed upon the dune where the package had
been buried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the tide low we&rsquo;ll have plenty of time,&rdquo;
Jerry said. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go! Was the package buried
deep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than a foot,&rdquo; Penny supplied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then if it&rsquo;s here, we&rsquo;ll find it. Let&rsquo;s block this
area off and cover it systematically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour the trio toiled. Twice one of the
beach guards passed by and Penny was surprised that
he paid no heed to what they were doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders!&rdquo; Jerry chuckled. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think we
could come out here and prowl around without questions
being asked? The guard was tipped off. He&rsquo;ll
help us by whistling if anyone comes this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise, who had been industriously digging, gave
a low cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find something?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant Louise lifted a small package from
its sand tomb. Before Jerry could warn her, she had
torn apart the pasteboard cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it contains pencils!&rdquo; she exclaimed in disgust.
&ldquo;Pencils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry leaped to her side. One glance and he took
the box from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those objects may look like pencils,&rdquo; he drawled.
&ldquo;But take it from me, they&rsquo;re a bit more deadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had moved close. She and Louise stared in
awe at the collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bombs,&rdquo; Jerry explained briefly. &ldquo;One of these
little pencils contains enough explosive to blow us
all to Kingdom Come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</i></h2>
<p>The cardboard box contained in addition to
the pencil bombs a shiny knife and several grooved,
pear-shaped objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those?&rdquo; Louise asked curiously. &ldquo;They
look like hand grenades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they are,&rdquo; said Jerry, lifting one from
the box. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty useful weapon for close fighting.
A strong man can throw a grenade twenty-five
to thirty-five yards and it does damage over a large
area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gingerly inspected one of the grenades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t bite you,&rdquo; Jerry laughed. &ldquo;Nor will it
explode in your hand. When you&rsquo;re ready to throw
a grenade you hold it with the lever under your fingers.
Just before you toss it, pull the pin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it apt to explode while you&rsquo;re holding it?&rdquo;
Penny asked dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not while the lever is held. When the grenade
leaves the hand, the lever flies off. Then the fuse
ignites and in about seven seconds you have your
explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little gadgets,&rdquo; Penny said. She replaced the
grenade in its box and ran a finger over the sharp edge
of the steel-bladed knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline evidently planted these weapons here
for someone else to use,&rdquo; Jerry remarked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put
them back just as they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them back!&rdquo; Penny echoed. &ldquo;Why, Jerry,
wouldn&rsquo;t that be playing right into their hands?
Shouldn&rsquo;t we destroy these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s much wiser to have the place watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light dawned upon Penny. &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;In that way you hope to learn Mrs.
Deline&rsquo;s accomplices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry replaced everything in the box which he
carefully buried in the sand. Then he obliterated all
freshly made footmarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be necessary to watch this place for days,&rdquo;
he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of Mrs. Deline?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;Will
she be allowed complete freedom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for my superiors to decide. It seems to me,
though, that more is to be gained by allowing her to
remain at liberty than by arresting her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for jail myself,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just be patient,&rdquo; Jerry smiled. &ldquo;And whatever
you do, don&rsquo;t drop a hint to Mrs. Deline of what we
suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows I dislike her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, but don&rsquo;t let her guess that you
consider her guilty of anything more serious than
making a play for your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Dad? Shouldn&rsquo;t I warn him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take care of that part,&rdquo; Jerry smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Penny agreed reluctantly. &ldquo;Just be
sure that you don&rsquo;t muff it. Remember, you&rsquo;re playing
with my future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry finished smoothing out the footprints in the
sand and then escorted the girls to the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must report to Headquarters without delay,&rdquo;
he said, pausing at the hotel entrance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry
about the package. We&rsquo;ll have the place watched
every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jerry had gone, Penny and Louise entered
the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my father here yet?&rdquo; Penny asked the desk
clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss. And there&rsquo;s a message for him. As
soon as he comes in he&rsquo;s to call Major Gregg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny repeated the name thoughtfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a new one on me,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Dad seems to have
friends I know nothing about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Major comes to the hotel frequently,&rdquo;
the clerk returned, smiling. &ldquo;He and your father are
well acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls crossed the lobby to a drinking fountain,
Louise said teasingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve lost track of your father lately,
Penny. You&rsquo;ve been so upset about Mrs. Deline that
you&rsquo;ve scarcely noticed anything or anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s been holding out on me, that&rsquo;s evident.
Wonder what he&rsquo;s to call Major Gregg about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not wait up and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Penny approved instantly. &ldquo;He
and Mrs. Deline should be getting in anytime
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not waiting up,&rdquo; announced Louise with a
sleepy yawn. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;m on my way to bed this
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To prove her words she started for the elevator.
Penny debated whether or not to follow and finally
decided to remain in the lobby.</p>
<p>An hour elapsed. Penny was half asleep by the
time Mrs. Deline and Mr. Parker entered the hotel
together. They were chatting animatedly and would
not have seen her had she not scrambled from the
wing chair.</p>
<p>Seeing Penny, Mrs. Deline quickly bade Mr.
Parker good night and vanished into an elevator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have waited up,&rdquo; Mr. Parker chided
his daughter. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nearly midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an important message for you, Dad.
You&rsquo;re to call Major Gregg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker looked disconcerted. &ldquo;How long ago
did that call come, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About an hour ago. Or that&rsquo;s when I learned of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker went quickly to a telephone booth and
was gone for some time. When he returned his face
was animated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Mr. Parker replied, sliding into a
chair beside her and dropping his voice. &ldquo;A message
from Interceptor Headquarters. Monitoring machines
have traced the outlaw radio station again.
The broadcast finished about an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where was the station located this time,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemingly at or near the lighthouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lighthouse!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. She was so
startled that her voice rose to a high pitch, attracting
the attention of a passing bellboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud, Penny,&rdquo; her father warned. &ldquo;The
strange thing was that the broadcast seemed to come
from a cave, the same as before, although the monitoring
machines charted it as being close to the lighthouse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only one I know about near the Point is
Crystal Cave,&rdquo; Penny said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Dad,
maybe the broadcast did come from the lighthouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s government property. Penny, and the man
in charge is beyond suspicion. Furthermore, the
deep, echo effect couldn&rsquo;t come from anywhere except
a cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless it were a sound effect, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked, startled. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t get you, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, maybe the cave set-up is just a sound
effect and nothing more. Only the other night I
heard one in a radio play and it sounded as if the
actors really were in a cave. Isn&rsquo;t it done by an echo
chamber or something of the sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be possible,&rdquo; Mr. Parker agreed. &ldquo;At
Interceptor Headquarters it was assumed that a mistake
had been made in charting the location of the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the lighthouse hasn&rsquo;t been investigated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it should be!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;Louise
and I were there today and we saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Mr. Parker questioned as she suddenly
broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a lot that didn&rsquo;t look right,&rdquo; Penny finished,
deciding not to bring Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s name into
the discussion. &ldquo;Mr. McCoy had visitors and while
they were there he kept us locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My word! Why didn&rsquo;t you report to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we weren&rsquo;t entirely sure,&rdquo; Penny said
lamely. &ldquo;The door just closed and locked, and Mr.
McCoy let on that it had a trick latch. Then he released
us, but not until after the visitors had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the persons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we only heard their voices. We weren&rsquo;t able
to overhear any of the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without explaining what he intended to do, Mr.
Parker again closed himself into a telephone booth.
Not until he returned did he tell Penny that he had
called Interceptor Headquarters and that Army men
had been sent to the lighthouse to make a thorough
check-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; he said briskly, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re overdue
for bed, Penny. Better fly up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just now. I have a little unfinished business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, unwilling to go to bed when she
sensed adventure in the offing. As she groped in her
mind for an excuse to remain, the doors at the front
entrance to the hotel began to spin. Jerry came hurrying
into the lobby. Seeing Penny and her father
he made a straight line for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The code&rsquo;s been broken!&rdquo; he announced, addressing
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they learn, Jerry?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as you thought, Penny.&rdquo; Jerry dropped
his bombshell. &ldquo;Mrs. Deline definitely is an Enemy
Agent. Apparently she was sent to Sunset Beach to
aid that escaped prisoner I told you about!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>NIGHT ADVENTURE</i></h2>
<p>As Jerry made the startling announcement, Penny
glanced anxiously at her father. In the excitement
of the moment she had not thought how much of a
shock it might be to him to learn that Mrs. Deline was
an agent employed by a foreign country. To her
astonishment, he looked neither surprised nor dismayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have the proof, Jerry!&rdquo; Mr. Parker exclaimed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine! But what&rsquo;s all this about a
code? How did you stumble onto it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time for details now,&rdquo; Jerry answered tersely.
&ldquo;Penny turned the trick&mdash;she and Louise saw Mrs.
Deline bury a package in the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Deline brought that package from the
lighthouse,&rdquo; Penny interposed eagerly. &ldquo;Mr. McCoy
must have given it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan of action?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded.
&ldquo;Army men already have gone to the lighthouse to
search that place thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our job is to keep watch of the dune where the
package was buried. Naturally we have no way of
knowing what time anyone will show up there. It
may be an all night wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared.
&ldquo;Just as soon as I get an overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started toward the elevator, then came back to
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Mrs. Deline?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here
in the hotel. Went to her room only a few minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be placed under arrest,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Better
call her on the telephone and get her down here.
Don&rsquo;t let her suspect that you think anything is
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker vanished into the nearest telephone
booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; Penny murmured to Jerry.
&ldquo;I was sure Dad was head over heels in love with Mrs.
Deline. Why, it didn&rsquo;t even seem to ruffle him when
he learned the truth about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry grinned. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;that was
because he knew all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Penny was dumbfounded. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; she
stammered, &ldquo;You mean that Dad&rsquo;s been acting a part?
Pretending to admire Mrs. Deline while actually he
didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that. You see, your Dad became
interested in the outlaw radio station and the men
who operate it. By making inquiries before he left
Riverview, he obtained information that made him
think Mrs. Deline might be involved in some way.
He knew she never had been in China but spent many
years in Japan. He learned also that instead of being
a newspaper correspondent, she had carried on secret
work for various governments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad knew all that! And he never let on to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t very well, Penny. If you had guessed
the truth, you&rsquo;d have given it away by your manner&mdash;no
matter how much you tried to act natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a little nit-wit I&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not,&rdquo; Jerry denied warmly. &ldquo;Anyone
else would have acted the same. Without knowing
it, you helped your father a lot. You turned up evidence
he never could have obtained alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you fit into the picture, Jerry? Did
Dad send for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t send for anyone in the Army,&rdquo; Jerry
explained, grinning. &ldquo;By pure luck I was assigned
here on a special mission. Your father learned I was
coming, so we united forces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve both known from the first about
Mrs. Deline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a dark brown suspicion, Penny. But
no proof until tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep breath. Before she could ask
another question, her father came hurrying down the
hotel corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s not in her room!&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;She
doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went upstairs only a few minutes ago,&rdquo; Penny
recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did, but she&rsquo;s not there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;and failed to hear
the &rsquo;phone. We&rsquo;ll have to check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without explaining why the matter was urgent,
Mr. Parker arranged with the desk clerk to have one
of the hotel maids go to Mrs. Deline&rsquo;s room. While
the trio waited in the upstairs corridor, the woman
rapped several times on the bedroom door, and failing
to get a response, unlocked it with her master key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline!&rdquo; she called, softly at first, then in
a louder voice.</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>The maid then snapped on the light. &ldquo;Why,
there&rsquo;s no one here!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The bed&rsquo;s not been
slept in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was afraid of,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Parker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>With Jerry and Penny, he entered the bedroom.
Everything was in perfect order. However, Mrs.
Deline&rsquo;s suitcase was gone and all her belongings had
been removed from the closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s skipped without paying her room rent!&rdquo; the
maid exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call the manager!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was peering into the waste paper basket beside
the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she drew the attention of her father and
Jerry. &ldquo;Burned letters and papers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Digging into the basket, she brought up several
charred sheets of paper. They were unreadable and
crumpled in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a bad break for us&mdash;Mrs. Deline getting
away!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed in disgust. &ldquo;Evidently her
work at Sunset Beach is finished. She&rsquo;s moving on to
another pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she can&rsquo;t be far away,&rdquo; Penny reasoned.
&ldquo;After all, we know when she came to her room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There still may be a chance to nab her,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll notify the police to guard all the
roads and the airport. I&rsquo;ll report to Major Gregg
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without awaiting the arrival of the hotel manager,
the trio hastened to the lobby. There Jerry and Mr.
Parker made several telephone calls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s be on our way up the beach,&rdquo; Jerry
urged anxiously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve killed too much time as
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny half expected that her father would refuse
permission for her to go along. To her delight he
merely said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s no keeping you here, Penny.
Well, come with us. I guess you&rsquo;ve earned the right
by your good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a dark night, warm but misty. No lights
were showing outside the hotel, though far up the
beach the powerful lighthouse beacon cut swathes
across the black sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire coast for fifty miles is being watched.
I thought just on a chance we might keep vigil at the
place where Mrs. Deline buried the package of explosives.
Someone may show up there. On the other
hand, Penny tipped off the fact that she knew where
the bundle was buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline watched Louise and me through a spy
glass,&rdquo; Penny recalled ruefully. &ldquo;She knew we didn&rsquo;t
find the package though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our assignment anyhow,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;To
keep watch of that particular place until relieved by
Army men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>The Parker car was on the hotel lot close by. Getting
it, the trio took the beach road but stopped some
distance from the lighthouse. Not wishing the car
to attract the attention of any passer-by, it was left
parked on a private driveway. Jerry, Penny and
her father then crossed the dunes afoot and proceeded
up the beach until they came to their station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think this is the place?&rdquo; Penny asked skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; Jerry replied. &ldquo;Remember what
I told you about taking observations? Let&rsquo;s see if the
package is still here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began digging in one of the dunes. Almost at
once he came upon the box of explosives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly as we left it,&rdquo; he reported, replacing the
sand. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt anyone will come,&rdquo; Mr. Parker commented.
&ldquo;Probably afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High overhead and out of sight, Penny heard the
drone of planes on coastal patrol. She stared up into
the dark sky and then toward the sea. The tide was
coming in and long rolling waves washed the beach,
dashed themselves on the shoreline and retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get down out of sight,&rdquo; Jerry
warned. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t be seen from the road or the ocean
either one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this spot?&rdquo; Mr. Parker suggested,
pointing to a hollow between two giant dunes.</p>
<p>The place seemed exactly right, so the trio flattened
themselves on the sand. Jerry looked at the
luminous dial of his watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One fifteen,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;No sign of activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no sign of any soldiers,&rdquo; Mr. Parker added.
&ldquo;I hope that whoever is to take over here shows up
before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny said, snuggling close between her
father and Jerry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything should develop, it&rsquo;s apt to be serious
business,&rdquo; Jerry warned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think that
we tipped our hand and nothing will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour elapsed. During that time there was no
sound save the roar of the restless sea. The warm
sand made a comfortable couch, and despite her best
intentions, Penny caught herself dozing. She had all
she could do to keep awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it now?&rdquo; she presently asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thirty-five,&rdquo; Jerry answered. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
look as if there&rsquo;s to be any activity, but then the
night&rsquo;s young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night may be, but I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
grumbled, shifting into a more comfortable position.
&ldquo;Wonder when our relief is to show up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be some mix up on orders. We&rsquo;re probably
stuck here for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, Penny should return to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Dad! Anyway, if I left now I might
attract the attention of anyone watching this place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You thought that one up!&rdquo; her father chuckled.
&ldquo;Except for ourselves, there&rsquo;s no person within a
quarter of a mile of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong about that,&rdquo; murmured Jerry, stiffening
to alert attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jerry?&rdquo; Mr. Parker said quickly.
&ldquo;You act as if you were seeing things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Chief! Look to the right&mdash;between us and
the lighthouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker and Penny gazed intently in the direction
indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see a thing,&rdquo; Mr. Parker whispered. &ldquo;Your
eyes must be tricking you, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Jerry spoke, a shadowy figure emerged
from the mists. The man came swiftly down the
beach, making no sound as he walked. When he was
very close, the revolving beacon of the lighthouse
singled him out for a fleeting instant. Brief as was
the moment of illumination, Penny recognized the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Emory!&rdquo; she whispered tensely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
he doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>OUT OF THE SEA</i></h2>
<p>The answer to Penny&rsquo;s whispered question soon
became obvious. George Emory looked carefully
about the windswept beach. The three tense watchers
thought that he might approach the dune where
they lay hidden, but he did not.</p>
<p>Instead, the man paused while several yards away
and gazed toward the sea. A moment he stood thus,
silhouetted against the sky. Then using a glowing
flashlight, he began making wide sweeps with his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A signal!&rdquo; Jerry whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to attract
the attention of a boat out at sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go for him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Jerry advised. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the only one
we&rsquo;re after. We&rsquo;re stalking bigger game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At intervals for the next fifteen minutes, George
Emory repeated the flashlight signals. Then he
turned off the light and waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Anxiously, Jerry, Penny and Mr. Parker kept their
faces turned to the sea. They sensed that the hour of
action was at hand, and it worried them that Army
men had failed to arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dad!&rdquo; Penny suddenly whispered. She
had glimpsed far from shore a long shadowy object
which easily could be a boat. No lights were showing
nor had she heard any sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a thing,&rdquo; Mr. Parker whispered back.
&ldquo;Yes! Now I do! Jove! It looks like a submarine
that&rsquo;s surfaced. I can make out the conning tower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would it dare come here?&rdquo; Penny
speculated. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be detected by the patrol
planes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight&rsquo;s a bad night,&rdquo; Jerry pointed out. &ldquo;Besides,
the shore is so indented at this point of coast
that perfect protection is almost impossible. They&rsquo;re
sending a boat, that&rsquo;s sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small craft had been launched from the wave-washed
deck of the submarine. Manned by two men
who rowed with muffled oars, it slowly approached
the shore. When it was very close the watchers behind
the sand dune saw by its grotesque sausage shape
that it was a large, rubber boat. Like a gray ghost
it slid over the water.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker gripped Penny&rsquo;s hand in an encouraging
squeeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you were safe at the hotel,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;I was a fool to let you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s heart pounded but she shook her head
vigorously. Not for anything would she have missed
the adventure. However, she was cool headed
enough to realize that the situation was not shaping
up well for her father and Jerry.</p>
<p>There were two men visible in the rubber boat,
unquestionably armed. Then George Emory must
be reckoned with and the arrival of others might be
expected at any moment. Jerry carried a revolver
but her father had no weapon. Already it was too
late for any member of the trio to safely go for
help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sub may intend to land Secret Agents here,&rdquo;
Jerry speculated. &ldquo;But from the code message we
deciphered, it&rsquo;s more likely they plan to take aboard
one or more passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that escaped flier,&rdquo; Penny supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a valuable man to them. Well worth the
risk they&rsquo;re taking to try to rescue him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If passengers are to go aboard, where are they?&rdquo;
Penny whispered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here but George
Emory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must wait and watch. We&rsquo;ll soon see enough
or I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>The rubber boat had reached the surf and was being
churned by the waves. Two men in full military
uniform, leaped out and guided the boat to the beach.
George Emory waded out to meet them. Shaking
the hand of each, he spoke rapidly in German.
Though Mr. Parker understood the language, he was
unable to catch a word.</p>
<p>Tensely, the trio waited and watched. At any
moment they feared that the men from the submarine
might seek the cache of explosives hidden not
far away. Soberly Jerry and Mr. Parker considered
trying to reach the box in the sand. To do so they
must cross an open, unprotected span of beach with
every likelihood of being seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see what happens,&rdquo; Mr. Parker advised.
&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t risk calling attention to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Emory and his two companions obviously
were awaiting someone. Nervously they paced the
beach. Several times Mr. Emory looked at his watch.
Then from far down the road came the sound of a
car traveling at high speed. Tires screamed in protest
as the auto came to a sudden halt on the paved
road back from the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve waited!&rdquo; Jerry whispered.</p>
<p>Barely a minute elapsed before two figures were
seen coming swiftly from the direction of the road.
A man and a woman crawled through the bushes,
under the fence, and walked hurriedly across deep
sand to the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Deline!&rdquo; Penny identified the woman. &ldquo;The
man with her is the same fellow who stole food from
our camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know his face from photographs I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo;
contributed Jerry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Oscar Kleinbrock, escaped
German prisoner. The man I was sent here to trace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline and her companion reached the group
of men who awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are five minutes late,&rdquo; George Emory reproved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we help it?&rdquo; Mrs. Deline snapped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
lucky to be here at all. Do you know that the road
is being watched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Army men. We were nearly stopped but were
able to turn off into the thicket and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no time to waste in talk,&rdquo; George
Emory said curtly. Turning, he spoke to the German
flier in his own language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s telling him to get aboard the rubber boat,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker interpreted tensely. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re saying
goodbye to Emory and Mrs. Deline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow we must hold them all here!&rdquo; Jerry
whispered grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two against five. And they&rsquo;re armed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker and Jerry looked at each other, fully
realizing how slim was their chance of success. They
were not thinking of themselves but of Penny and
what could happen to her if they failed. Mr. Parker
touched her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Slip away in the darkness
and make a dash for the hotel. Jerry and I will
try to hold them until help comes. Just keep low as
you run or those fiends may take a pot-shot at you.&rdquo;
Penny would not desert her father and Jerry.
Stubbornly, she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know that you are safe,&rdquo; Jerry urged.
&ldquo;Please go while you still have a chance. You can
help us most by bringing help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s determination to remain, weakened. Yet
reason told her she never could reach the hotel and
return with help in time to do any good. It dawned
upon her that Jerry was only saying what he did to
get her safely away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had the box of explosives!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;With it we might have a chance against
those men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to dig up the box now,&rdquo; said Jerry.
&ldquo;We probably couldn&rsquo;t find it without a light. And
the noise we&rsquo;d make&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; Penny interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, see if you can get your hands on the
box,&rdquo; her father agreed suddenly. &ldquo;Slip back of the
dune, and then circle. Don&rsquo;t try to cross the beach.
Be careful! Remember the least sound will bring a
hail of bullets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and slipped away into the darkness,
crawling on hands and knees. Barely had she left
the shelter of the big sand dune than she heard two
shots fired in quick succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those came from Jerry&rsquo;s revolver!&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Oh, it was a trick to get me safely away! Now he
and Dad are in for fireworks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raising her head above the protecting sand dune,
Penny saw why Jerry had fired. The rubber boat
was being launched. To delay the attack would
mean that the entire party might escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all get away!&rdquo; Penny thought in dismay.
&ldquo;How can Jerry and Dad hold them single handed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Emory returned Jerry&rsquo;s fire with deadly
aim. The bullets bit into the dune, throwing up little
geysers of sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launch the boat!&rdquo; he shouted savagely to the men
from the submarine. &ldquo;Get away while you can! Be
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Mr. Parker were determined that the
party should not escape. As the men sought to launch
the rubber boat, they made a concerted rush for the
German flier who was to be taken aboard the waiting
submarine. Caught by surprise, he went down beneath
their blows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Fearful of hitting his own man, George Emory
dared not fire again. Instead, he and the crewmen of
the submarine fell upon Jerry and Mr. Parker. In
the melee, one person could not be distinguished from
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools! Fools!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Deline as she watched
the fierce, uneven struggle. &ldquo;There is no time to be
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Mr. Parker were putting up the fight of
their lives, but they were no match for four able
bodied, trained men. Penny, desperate with anxiety,
saw that the struggle could end only in one way&mdash;disaster
for Jerry and her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had that box of explosives maybe I could help
them!&rdquo; flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>Rolling over a dune, she ran to the place near the
fence where she thought the cache was buried. Frantically
she clawed and dug at the sand. She could
not find the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be here!&rdquo; she told herself desperately.
&ldquo;Or was it hidden in the next dune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried another place slightly to the right. As
she dug, she heard a sound behind her. Turning
swiftly, she saw Mrs. Deline starting across the beach
toward her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the woman shouted.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s hand encountered something hard and
firm. The box of explosives! Digging wildly, she
lifted it from the bed of sand and sprang to her feet.
Her fingers closed upon one of the hand grenades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; she ordered Mrs. Deline, balancing
herself as if to throw.</p>
<p>The woman stopped short, then retreated a few
steps. But only for a moment was she frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you infant, you couldn&rsquo;t throw a grenade!&rdquo;
she jeered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how. Besides, you
haven&rsquo;t the nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; Penny ordered again. &ldquo;I warn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline laughed scornfully and came on.</p>
<p>Even the thought of throwing a hand grenade terrified
Penny. She knew that she could not deliberately
harm Mrs. Deline or even the men who were mercilessly
beating her father and Jerry. Yet she had to
do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can destroy the rubber boat!&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far enough away so that no one should
be hurt by the explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whirling away from Mrs. Deline, Penny faced the
sea. Fixing her eyes on her target, the rubber boat
at the water&rsquo;s edge, she hurled the grenade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Deline, flinging herself flat on
the sand to protect her face from flying fragments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Penny did likewise. The grenade dropped with
a thud on the sand beside the rubber boat. Her aim
had been perfect. But there was no explosion. Belatedly,
Penny realized that she had forgotten to pull
the safety pin.</p>
<p>Mrs. Deline kept her face buried beneath her arms
and did not yet know what had happened. Sick with
the knowledge that she had failed, Penny was desperate.
Her father and Jerry were being cruelly
beaten by their opponents. In another minute they
would be overpowered and the Germans would escape
to the waiting submarine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let them get away!&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;I
must do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering the pencil bombs, she groped in the
cardboard box for them. They were not there. Instead,
her fingers closed upon the sharp bladed knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slash the rubber boat!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try
to make a hole in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Deline realized what the girl was about,
Penny darted down the beach. The men from the
submarine did not see her. Reaching the rubber boat,
she leaped into it. Working with desperate haste,
she jabbed the knife through the bottom. The material
was tough and it took all of her strength to
make a long jagged gash. Water seeped in, slowly at
first, then faster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; Penny thought jubilantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her triumph was fleeting. The next instant the
girl was struck a hard stunning blow from behind.
As she collapsed in a limp little heap on the sand, she
dimly saw the cruel, angry face of Mrs. Deline. Then
all went black and she knew no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>A SCOOP FOR UNCLE SAM</i></h2>
<p>Penny opened her eyes and wondered where
she was. For a moment she could remember nothing
of what had transpired. Gradually, she realized that
she was lying down, her head pillowed in someone&rsquo;s
lap. She seemed to be in a fast-moving motor boat
for she could hear the wash of waves against the craft.
In panic she decided that she must be a prisoner enroute
to the German submarine. She struggled to
sit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy there, partner,&rdquo; said a soothing voice.</p>
<p>Penny twisted sideways to look at the speaker.
&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he said, pressing her gently
back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you to a doctor in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A doctor, my eye!&rdquo; Penny protested with spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a nasty blow Mrs. Deline gave you on
the head,&rdquo; contributed another voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Penny turned again and saw her father. His shirt
was half torn off and there was a long gash on his
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a few scratches, Penny. Jerry took
worse punishment than I did. But you should see
the other fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;Where am I
anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a patrol boat bound for the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened on the beach? The last I remember
was when I tried to slash the rubber boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not only tried, you did!&rdquo; chuckled Jerry.
&ldquo;Mrs. Deline struck you on the head with something&mdash;maybe
a rock&mdash;and you went down for the count.
About that time, some of the Army boys arrived.
Mrs. Deline and her crowd tried to make a get-away,
but the boat couldn&rsquo;t be launched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo; Penny demanded as Jerry
paused for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two members of the sub crew tried to swim.
They were picked up by a patrol boat that had been
drawn to the locality by the gun fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Deline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and her pal Emory, together with the escaped
flier, struck off across the sand dunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t get away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life. They reached the road and
there found a nice reception awaiting them! Right
now the three are lodged at Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took a deep breath. Her head was throbbing
but she scarcely felt the pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Jim McCoy at the lighthouse?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was taken into custody earlier in the evening.
A portable broadcasting outfit was found on the
premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. McCoy really was the man responsible
for those mysterious broadcasts&mdash;the Voice from the
Cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt he had helpers,&rdquo; Mr. Parker contributed.
&ldquo;We expect to track down most of the ring
now that the leaders have been captured. At any
rate, we&rsquo;ve put an end to the broadcasts. Your other
theory was right too, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What theory, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the cave effect was produced by an echo
chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then no broadcast ever originated in a cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. We know McCoy shifted locations
frequently. Tonight was the first time he ever
dared broadcast from the lighthouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the old beachcomber, Jake Skagway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a beachcomber,&rdquo; Jerry answered. &ldquo;He had
no connection with Emory or Mrs. Deline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny lay perfectly still for a few minutes, gazing
up at the dark sky. A few stars pricked the black
canopy above her, and now and then a quarter moon
peeped from behind a cloud screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get aboard this boat?&rdquo; she presently
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another patrol boat came by,&rdquo; Jerry explained.
&ldquo;In fact, after all the fireworks, just about everyone
in Sunset Beach arrived on the scene. We wanted to
get you to a doctor so we took the first transportation
that offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there now too,&rdquo; added Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>Penny sat up. The shore was dark but she could
dimly see the dark Crystal Inn hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a doctor,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling
better every minute. My, won&rsquo;t Louise be green
with envy when she learns what she missed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say she was lucky,&rdquo; Mr. Parker corrected.
&ldquo;Penny, you don&rsquo;t seem to realize what a narrow
escape we all had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added Jerry, &ldquo;those men were desperate,
and they&rsquo;d have stopped at nothing. I guess
we owe our lives to you, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny loved the praise. Nevertheless, she replied
with a show of modesty:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t do a thing, Jerry. As a matter of
record, I nearly messed up the show. When I threw
that hand grenade I forgot to pull the safety pin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did,&rdquo; chuckled Jerry. &ldquo;If it had
exploded, we might not be here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sat very still, thinking over what had happened.
Events were a bit hazy in her mind and many
questions remained unanswered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The submarine?&rdquo; she asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunk,&rdquo; Jerry replied. &ldquo;One of our patrol planes
scored a direct hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that brings me up to date,&rdquo; Penny sighed,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing that bothers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know who Mrs. Deline was when you invited
her to come with us to Sunset Beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I had a healthy suspicion that she might
be working against our country, Penny. I first met
Mrs. Deline at the Club. However, she was rather
transparent in making a play for my attention. In
checking up I discovered that she never had been in
China and never had written a newspaper story in
her life. When she practically invited herself to ride
with us to Sunset Beach, I thought I&rsquo;d try to find out
more about her little game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I acted so silly about everything,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged,
deeply ashamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be, Penny. At times you were rude
to Mrs. Deline which was wrong. But your actions
served a good purpose by keeping the woman so
diverted that she never was on her guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shore was very close. As the powerful engines of
the motor boat became muted, Penny said wistfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that your work is done here, Jerry, I suppose
you&rsquo;ll be winging off to some far corner of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a few days at least,&rdquo; he reassured her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting a furlough and I&rsquo;ll spend it right here
at Sunset Beach. We&rsquo;ll cram those days full of fun,
Penny. We&rsquo;ll swim and golf and dance. We&rsquo;ll make
every minute count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat grated gently against the dock and a
sailor leaped out to make the craft fast. Mr. Parker
and Jerry helped Penny ashore. Though she tried
to stand steady upon her feet, the boards rocked beneath
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hook on,&rdquo; invited Jerry, offering an arm.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker supported her on the other side, and
thus they walked slowly toward the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Three Musketeers!&rdquo; chuckled the editor.
&ldquo;&lsquo;One for all, and all for one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do make a trio,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;Tonight
it seems just as it did when we were together in Riverview
working on a big news story. There&rsquo;s one
difference though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight we were actors in a little drama that
should be page one on any newspaper. Yet neither
of you news hawks so much as spoke of trying to get
a scoop for the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good reason,&rdquo; rumbled Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The story
of what happened tonight may never be published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Dad. If the news were printed
now it might give valuable information to the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paused to catch her breath. With Jerry
and her father still supporting her, she turned to face
the restless sea. The patrol boat had slipped away
into the darkness. Far up shore, unmindful that her
faithless master had gone, the bright beacon from the
lighthouse swept the water at regular intervals.
Nothing seemed changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curtain going down on one of the best adventures
of my life,&rdquo; Penny said softly. &ldquo;Who cares that the
<i>Riverview Star</i> missed the story? Why, this was an
A-1 scoop for Uncle Sam!&rdquo;</p>
